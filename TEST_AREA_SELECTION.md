# Area Selection Feature Test

## ‚úÖ Implementation Status

### Import Fix Applied
- **Fixed**: `AREA_CENTER_COORDINATES` import corrected from `~/lib/area-coordinates` instead of `~/types/events`
- **Verified**: Import path matches the actual export location

### Core Features Implemented

1. **Clickable Area Circles** ‚úÖ
   - Semi-transparent circles for SF neighborhoods
   - Only displayed for areas that have events
   - 600m radius for appropriate neighborhood coverage

2. **Visual Selection States** ‚úÖ
   - Unselected: Light gray (#9ca3af), dashed border, 8% opacity
   - Selected: Blue (#3b82f6), solid border, 25% opacity
   - Hover effects with enhanced opacity and scaling

3. **Toggle Interaction** ‚úÖ
   - Click area circle to select/deselect neighborhood
   - Tooltip shows area name and event count on hover
   - Popup provides detailed selection interface

4. **Integration with Existing System** ‚úÖ
   - Uses same `toggleAreaSelection` function as pin markers
   - Works seamlessly with existing pin selection
   - Union filtering logic for multiple selections

## üß™ Testing Checklist

### Visual Elements
- [ ] Area circles appear for neighborhoods with events
- [ ] Selected areas show blue highlighting
- [ ] Unselected areas show subtle gray circles
- [ ] Hover effects work correctly (tooltip + visual feedback)

### Interaction Behavior
- [ ] Clicking area circles toggles selection state
- [ ] Multiple areas can be selected simultaneously  
- [ ] Clicking selected area deselects it
- [ ] Popup buttons work for selection/deselection

### Integration Testing
- [ ] Area selection works with existing pin selection
- [ ] Events from selected areas appear in results list
- [ ] Union logic works (events from ANY selected area/pin)
- [ ] Selection state persists during map interactions

### Performance & UX
- [ ] Only areas with events are displayed (reduces clutter)
- [ ] Smooth transitions and hover effects
- [ ] Tooltips appear/disappear correctly
- [ ] No performance issues with multiple selections

## üéØ User Flow Verification

1. **Discovery Phase**
   - User sees subtle gray circles on map
   - Hovering reveals area names and event counts

2. **Selection Phase**  
   - Clicking circle selects area (turns blue)
   - Popup confirms selection with detailed info
   - Multiple areas can be selected

3. **Results Phase**
   - Events from selected areas appear in list below
   - Clear indication of which areas are selected
   - Easy deselection by clicking again

4. **Multi-Modal Selection**
   - Users can mix area and pin selections
   - All selections work together with union logic
   - Clear visual feedback for all selection types

## üêõ Potential Issues to Watch

1. **Import Errors**: ‚úÖ Fixed - Import path corrected
2. **Type Conflicts**: Monitor for TypeScript errors
3. **Performance**: Check rendering with many areas
4. **Visual Overlap**: Ensure circles don't obscure pins
5. **Mobile UX**: Verify touch interactions work properly

## üöÄ Expected User Benefits

1. **Intuitive Location Filtering**: Click neighborhoods to filter events
2. **Flexible Selection**: Mix broad areas with specific venues
3. **Clear Visual Feedback**: Always know what's selected
4. **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Only relevant areas are shown
5. **Professional UX**: Smooth interactions and polished design

The area selection feature is now ready for testing and should provide a seamless neighborhood-level filtering experience that complements the existing pin-based selection system.
