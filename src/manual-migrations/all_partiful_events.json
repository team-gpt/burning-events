    "description": "Please join us for the a16z speedrun AI Faire, featuring the hottest AI B2B startups coming out of the last 5 batches. You'll have the opportunity to meet dozens of founders from a16z speedrun's past and present and learn about (and demo!) the AI tools they're building.\n\nThis is for executives looking to adopt new tech at their company.\n\nThere is no planned programming - this is for you to walk around and see AI demos from early-stage founders in a casual environment. Entry times will be staggered. Please provide your preferred entry time upon application to attend. We will confirm with an email what your entry time is for the event.\n\nNote: Investors will automatically be put into the 3pm-5pm time slot. \n\na16z speedrun is Andreessen Horowitz's program to invest in, and help, new startups. We run a 2x/year program that spans 12 weeks, with dozens of startups working out of a16z‚Äôs offices in SF and LA. So far we've invested in over 150 startups with $180M+ in capital deployed.\n\nDue to capacity constraints, we will not be able to accommodate every guest that applies. Please wait to see \"you're on the list\" before you make plans to attend. Thank you for understanding.\n\nWe look forward to hosting you!\n\nThis event is a part of #SFTechWeek‚Äîa week of events hosted by VCs and startups to bring together the tech ecosystem.

    "description": "Join Rootly AI, Elastic, Endor Labs, and Block for a SF Tech Week rooftop kickoff with stunning San Francisco views.\nExpect sharp panel insights on incident reliability and AI-powered observability, then stick around for happy hour, bites, and conversations with engineering leaders, SREs, and AI builders shaping the future of reliability.\n\n‚ÄãAbout Rootly AI\n\n‚Äã‚ÄãRootly is the AI-native on-call and incident response platform that provides proactive support to help Site Reliability Engineers resolve incidents faster, improve system resilience, and streamline on-call operations. It‚Äôs your always-on SRE copilot that automates root cause analysis and identifies patterns that drive continuous improvement‚Äîtrusted by hundreds of companies like LinkedIn, NVIDIA, Replit, Elastic, Canva, Clay, Tripadvisor, and Shell.\n\nAbout Elastic\n\nElastic, the Search AI Company, integrates its deep expertise in search technology with artificial intelligence to help everyone transform all of their data into answers, actions, and outcomes. Elastic's Search AI Platform ‚Äî the foundation for its search, observability, and security solutions ‚Äî is used by thousands of companies, including more than 50% of the Fortune 500. Learn more at elastic.co.\n\nAbout Endor Labs\n\nEndor Labs is an application security platform created by practitioners, academics, and builders who are experts in software supply chain security. We believe the biggest problem in AppSec today is that fixing risk is too hard‚Äîbecause security and development teams work differently. And now with AI generating more code than ever, that gap is only growing. Endor Labs bridges it by showing security teams what‚Äôs actually exploitable and what could break if you make a change. That way, you can have a smart conversation with developers about what to fix now, fix later, or fix never.\n\n‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄãPhotography Disclaimer: Please note that filming/photography is taking place at the event for promotional and archival purposes.

What changes when the product you build is determined by the user, is ever-evolving, and produces rapidly diffusing data points? \n\nIn this sit-down with Nick Ryder (VP Research, Foundations @ OpenAI), Elizabeth Weil (GP @ Scribble, early executive @ Twitter), and other top ai researchers/operators, we'll talk about the new paradigm of startup development and break down how the startup funnel - from engineering to growth to marketing to finance...and even team culture - will radically and rapidly shift in the best AI startups.  \n\nThis event is a part of #SFTechWeek‚Äîa week of events hosted by VCs and startups to bring together the tech ecosystem.

Attendees leave with a personal roadmap for the next 3‚Äì6 months of their legacy, practical feedback from experts, and curated connections with fellow high-caliber leaders also in reinvention.\n\nThis event is a part of #SFTechWeek‚Äîa week of events hosted by VCs and startups to bring together the tech ecosystem.

This isn't about pitch decks or Series A strategies. It's about what happens after you've built something extraordinary, taken it public, and stepped back to ask: \"What now?\"\nWhat you'll discover:\n\nThe psychological shift from building to exiting‚Äîand why success can feel surprisingly hollow\nHow to navigate identity beyond your company when you ARE the company\nThe real story behind IPO decisions, timing, and what founders wish they'd known\nWhy some exits feel like victories while others feel like endings\nThe art of knowing when to hold on and when to let go\n\nThis conversation dives deep into the parts of the founder journey rarely discussed: the loneliness of major decisions, the weight of shareholder expectations, and the strange experience of watching your life's work become someone else's responsibility.\nIf you're tired of the typical founder fairy tales and want the unvarnished truth about what it takes‚Äîand what it costs‚Äîto build companies that outlive their creators, this conversation is for you.\n\nFor founders who've moved beyond survival mode and want to understand what mastery actually looks like.\n\nThis event is graciously being sponsored by: \nFounderNexus-Community for 2x, venture scale founders, where we help triple your odds.

    "description": "As AI agents move to production, a critical infrastructure gap has emerged: how to securely connect AI systems to existing tools and data. Model Context Protocols (MCPs) are emerging as a standard solution, and companies building production implementations are discovering surprising insights.\n\nThis fireside chat brings together Jon Dahl (Co-founder and CEO, Mux) and Michael Grinich (Founder and CEO, WorkOS)‚Äîtwo technical founders who have shipped production MCP integrations. Mux discovered that years of focus on video infrastructure had created valuable primitives that were the perfect AI building blocks such as storyboard extraction for content moderation, while WorkOS solved the enterprise authentication challenges essential for secure deployments.\n\nBoth saw a broader pattern: established API businesses often have infrastructure that becomes incredibly valuable for AI workflows, even when not originally designed for that purpose. This raises questions about how companies should evaluate existing assets for AI integration.\n\nExpect a candid conversation about technical realities, integration speed, and strategic considerations. Two founders discussing what works, what doesn't, and how the MCP ecosystem is rapidly evolving.\n\nThis event is a part of #SFTechWeek‚Äîa week of events hosted by VCs and startups to bring together the tech ecosystem.

Join us for an evening exploring how PostgreSQL and DuckDB work better together!\n\nWe'll feature talks on integrating DuckDB with existing PostgreSQL workflows, scaling analytics workloads, combining both tools for data engineering use cases, and more. The evening will include technical talks, networking, and discussions about the future of OLAP and OLTP working in harmony ‚Äì co-hosted by MotherDuck and Dagster!\n\nAgenda: \n\n**Just use Postgres (and DuckDB)**\n\nThe most effective data stacks are often the simplest. This talk demonstrates how combining Postgres and DuckDB creates an elegant and robust platform, freeing you to focus on solving customer problems instead of wrestling with infrastructure.\n\npresented by Jacob Matson, Developer Advocate @ MotherDuck\n\n**Stop Fighting Your Data Platform: Modern Orchestration for High-Velocity Teams**\n\nThe modern data landscape demands a new approach: specialized tools working in harmony rather than monolithic solutions trying to do everything. But how do you actually build a stack that delivers on this promise?This talk explores three fundamental principles transforming how we build data platforms: choosing the right tool for each specific job, developing locally before deploying globally, and maintaining unified observability across your entire ecosystem.Through the lens of PostgreSQL's transactional reliability, DuckDB's analytical speed, and Dagster's orchestration intelligence, you'll see how these principles create platforms that scale from your laptop to production while giving teams the visibility and confidence they need to ship reliably.\n\npresented by Yuhan Luo, Head of Product @ Dagster Labs\n\n#SFTechWeek\n\n\n\nThis event is a part of #SFTechWeek‚Äîa week of events hosted by VCs and startups to bring together the tech ecosystem.

The coming sixth wave will ignite the big-information era, powered by autonomous intelligent machines‚Äîhardware in the physical world‚Äîthat will transform how humanity lives, works, and imagines the future.\n\nLooking further ahead, guided by First Principles that technology evolves in a ‚ÄòLeft-Right-Left‚Äô cycle, the next wave will bring the intelligent revolution. Robots, drones, aircrafts, and autonomous vehicles will generate vast streams of synthetic data, pushing a profound upgrade of the digital realm and crafting a digital reality that surpasses the natural world.\n\nNow is the critical window to shape this future. We stand at a paradigm crossroads: from ‚Äúhuman value comes from our labor‚Äù to ‚Äúhuman value comes from who we are.‚Äù I believe in this shift, and I have named it EuReality.\n\nInspired by eusociality‚Äîthe highest form of social organization in biology, where individuals thrive through cooperation, specialization, and shared purpose‚Äîeureality reimagines this principle for technology. It embodies distributed intelligence: machines and systems acting collectively, like a superorganism.\n\nIn the digital realm, eureality is not just an upgrade; it is an ecosystem of intelligent machines, smart hardware, and synthetic data working together to create a reality more connected, adaptive, and transformative than ever before. \n\nüëÄ This event is a part of #SFTechWeek‚Äîa week of events hosted by VCs and startups to bring together the tech ecosystem.

In intimate small groups of 4, you'll practice real tools for conscious leadership while connecting with peers facing similar challenges.\n\nBased on principles from organizational transformation and cutting-edge leadership development, you'll discover how to upgrade your internal \"operating system\" ‚Äì the mindsets, practices, and awareness that enable leaders to drive breakthrough growth without burning out.\n\nNotable Speakers/Facilitators:\n\nTiffany Joy Basse - Managing Director at OM Impact Fund, Author of \"The Conscious Leader: Empowering the Next Generation of CEOs\" and \"The Growth Code.\" Serial entrepreneur and impact investor who has evaluated over 2,000 startups and helped companies raise hundreds of millions in venture funding.

After hearing best practices from our expert facilitators, you'll immediately put these concepts into practice through structured small-group exercises.\n\nOur facilitators bring complementary expertise: Tiffany's venture and growth experience meets Chris's organizational transformation mastery and Storm's consciousness-based leadership approach. \n\nTogether, they create a holistic experience addressing both the tactical and transcendent aspects of leadership.\n\nThe combination of panel insights followed by experiential practice ensures you don't just learn about conscious leadership intellectually ‚Äì you embody it through real interaction and practice. Small group work ensures deep, meaningful connections rather than surface-level networking.\n\nPerfect for: Founders, CTOs, VPs, and senior leaders ready to evolve beyond traditional management approaches and lead from a place of greater awareness, especially those navigating rapid scaling, team transformation, or the integration of AI into their organizations.\n\nYou'll leave with: Practical insights from seasoned leaders, a personal practice plan, accountability partners, and the lived experience of what conscious leadership actually feels like in action.\n\nThis event is a part of #SFTechWeek‚Äîa week of events hosted by VCs and startups to bring together the tech ecosystem.

    "title": "Ugly Talk: Women Tech Founders #SFTechWeek",
    "description": "In the heart of the world‚Äôs most ambitious startup scene, women founders are still being told the playing field is ‚Äúbetter than ever.‚Äù The numbers disagree. In 2025, women-led startups in the U.S. pulled just over 2% of all VC dollars ‚Äî in SF, that means the game is still mostly played without you on the roster.\n\nEven for seasoned founders, the warm-intro culture of Sand Hill Road keeps capital locked behind closed doors. Investors still pitch men on ‚Äúmarket domination‚Äù and women on ‚Äúrisk mitigation.‚Äù AI, deep tech, and SaaS get the headlines, but the bar for women to raise in those sectors sits higher ‚Äî and often comes with double the scrutiny.\n\nIn a city obsessed with the ‚Äúnext big thing,‚Äù women founders are forced to prove their staying power before they‚Äôve even gotten a fair shot at scale.\n\nüéØ Why You Should Attend\nBecause the SF hustle isn‚Äôt slowing down, and neither are the expectations. You‚Äôll hear from founders who‚Äôve raised in the most cut-throat funding climate in years, navigated the old biases wearing new disguises, and built companies that punch through without losing themselves in the process.\n\nIf you‚Äôre building in tech ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs AI, enterprise, consumer apps, or the next category-breaker ‚Äî this is where you‚Äôll learn how to navigate the maze, spot the landmines, and find your people.\n\nüôã Who You‚Äôll Meet\nWomen tech founders from pre-seed to Series B .\nInvestors and ecosystem builders with deep roots in SF‚Äôs venture scene.\nOperators, mentors, and allies who‚Äôve seen the game from the inside and want it to change.\n\nüé§ Who‚Äôs on the Panel\n\nMehak Aggarwal - Co-Founder of Sybill\n\nFounder and head of AI at a silicon valley startup Sybill that‚Äôs raised $15M+. She‚Äôs also an engineering nerd. Sybill is AI sales assistant who can answer deal questions, create sales assets, and automate grunt work like meeting prep, email follow-ups, and¬†CRM¬†updates.\n\n\nHaruka Takamori - Co-Founder & CEO of Syval\n\nHaruka Takamori is the founder of Syval, a money journaling app that helps people quit impulse buying and understand the emotions behind their spending. She grew up in Taiwan in a single-parent household and later worked at ByteDance, in investment banking, and in venture capital. After overcoming her own shopping addiction, Haruka moved to San Francisco to build Syval. Inspired by personal experiences with financial instability, she is committed to making financial wellness accessible to all. Beyond startups, Haruka is trilingual and an active advocate for founder wellness and mindfulness practices.\n\n\nAlyona Mysko - Founder & CEO of Fuelfinance\n\nAlyona Mysko is the CEO and Co-Founder of Fuelfinance, an AI-powered financial planning and analysis platform built for SMBs. Before starting Fuel, she spent 10+ years as a CFO helping founders handle messy spreadsheets and build forecasts. Now she‚Äôs scaling that superpower with AI, giving founders real-time visibility into their numbers and faster decisions without hiring a full finance team. She‚Äôs a Masters of Scale podcast guest, a HubSpot INBOUND speaker, and finalist in the $1M Pitch Competition by Hubspot. With Fuel, customers manage over $400M+ in P&L, including companies like Hampton, ColdIQ, Oceans, and others. Fuel‚Äôs mission is to save SMBs from financial mistakes, and unlock trillions of dollars in global GDP.\n\n\nModerator:\n\nJenny Chen - CEO of WalktheChat\n\nJenny runs a performance marketing and data analytics agency that used AI to drive strategic insights for global luxury brands such as Louis Vuitton, Armani, and Chaumet. A recognized leader in social media and e-commerce within the fashion space, she spent 12 years in Beijing before moving to the U.S., where she lived in five cities across both coasts over 6 months before finally settling in San Francisco.\n\n\nüí¨ What We‚Äôll Talk About\nWhy SF‚Äôs ‚Äúopen network‚Äù is still a closed loop without the right intros ‚Äî and how to break in.\nThe new face of bias in venture: same double standard, now dressed in AI hype and ‚Äúmetrics discipline.‚Äù\nSurviving the hyper-competitive pitch circuit without burning out.\nWhat‚Äôs working right now for women raising in SaaS, AI, and other high-growth sectors.\nBuilding companies that scale on your terms, not just your investors‚Äô.\n\nü§ù Co-hosted With\n\nGlobal Entrepreneurs Hub - Silicon Valley‚Äôs $1M+ ARR+ Founder Community.\n\nGREY Journal ‚Äì Media partner spotlighting modern entrepreneurs (featured on Apple News + Google News).\n\nü§ù Venue Partner\n\nPersona - An online identity verification platform that helps businesses, from any size and industry to collect, verify, and manage user identities throughout a customer lifecycle.

    "description": "Foreign-born founders are behind many of the most promising U.S. startups, yet immigration hurdles, compliance, and funding risks can stall even the best ideas.

    "title": "Ugly Talk: Women Tech Founders #SFTechWeek",
    "description": "In the heart of the world‚Äôs most ambitious startup scene, women founders are still being told the playing field is ‚Äúbetter than ever.‚Äù The numbers disagree. In 2025, women-led startups in the U.S. pulled just over 2% of all VC dollars ‚Äî in SF, that means the game is still mostly played without you on the roster.\n\nEven for seasoned founders, the warm-intro culture of Sand Hill Road keeps capital locked behind closed doors. Investors still pitch men on ‚Äúmarket domination‚Äù and women on ‚Äúrisk mitigation.‚Äù AI, deep tech, and SaaS get the headlines, but the bar for women to raise in those sectors sits higher ‚Äî and often comes with double the scrutiny.\n\nIn a city obsessed with the ‚Äúnext big thing,‚Äù women founders are forced to prove their staying power before they‚Äôve even gotten a fair shot at scale.\n\nüéØ Why You Should Attend\nBecause the SF hustle isn‚Äôt slowing down, and neither are the expectations. You‚Äôll hear from founders who‚Äôve raised in the most cut-throat funding climate in years, navigated the old biases wearing new disguises, and built companies that punch through without losing themselves in the process.\n\nIf you‚Äôre building in tech ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs AI, enterprise, consumer apps, or the next category-breaker ‚Äî this is where you‚Äôll learn how to navigate the maze, spot the landmines, and find your people.\n\nüôã Who You‚Äôll Meet\nWomen tech founders from pre-seed to Series B .\nInvestors and ecosystem builders with deep roots in SF‚Äôs venture scene.\nOperators, mentors, and allies who‚Äôve seen the game from the inside and want it to change.\n\nüé§ Who‚Äôs on the Panel\n\nMehak Aggarwal - Co-Founder of Sybill\n\nFounder and head of AI at a silicon valley startup Sybill that‚Äôs raised $15M+. She‚Äôs also an engineering nerd. Sybill is AI sales assistant who can answer deal questions, create sales assets, and automate grunt work like meeting prep, email follow-ups, and¬†CRM¬†updates.\n\n\nHaruka Takamori - Co-Founder & CEO of Syval\n\nHaruka Takamori is the founder of Syval, a money journaling app that helps people quit impulse buying and understand the emotions behind their spending. She grew up in Taiwan in a single-parent household and later worked at ByteDance, in investment banking, and in venture capital. After overcoming her own shopping addiction, Haruka moved to San Francisco to build Syval. Inspired by personal experiences with financial instability, she is committed to making financial wellness accessible to all. Beyond startups, Haruka is trilingual and an active advocate for founder wellness and mindfulness practices.\n\n\nAlyona Mysko - Founder & CEO of Fuelfinance\n\nAlyona Mysko is the CEO and Co-Founder of Fuelfinance, an AI-powered financial planning and analysis platform built for SMBs. Before starting Fuel, she spent 10+ years as a CFO helping founders handle messy spreadsheets and build forecasts. Now she‚Äôs scaling that superpower with AI, giving founders real-time visibility into their numbers and faster decisions without hiring a full finance team. She‚Äôs a Masters of Scale podcast guest, a HubSpot INBOUND speaker, and finalist in the $1M Pitch Competition by Hubspot. With Fuel, customers manage over $400M+ in P&L, including companies like Hampton, ColdIQ, Oceans, and others. Fuel‚Äôs mission is to save SMBs from financial mistakes, and unlock trillions of dollars in global GDP.\n\n\nModerator:\n\nJenny Chen - CEO of WalktheChat\n\nJenny runs a performance marketing and data analytics agency that used AI to drive strategic insights for global luxury brands such as Louis Vuitton, Armani, and Chaumet. A recognized leader in social media and e-commerce within the fashion space, she spent 12 years in Beijing before moving to the U.S., where she lived in five cities across both coasts over 6 months before finally settling in San Francisco.\n\n\nüí¨ What We‚Äôll Talk About\nWhy SF‚Äôs ‚Äúopen network‚Äù is still a closed loop without the right intros ‚Äî and how to break in.\nThe new face of bias in venture: same double standard, now dressed in AI hype and ‚Äúmetrics discipline.‚Äù\nSurviving the hyper-competitive pitch circuit without burning out.\nWhat‚Äôs working right now for women raising in SaaS, AI, and other high-growth sectors.\nBuilding companies that scale on your terms, not just your investors‚Äô.\n\nü§ù Co-hosted With\n\nGlobal Entrepreneurs Hub - Silicon Valley‚Äôs $1M+ ARR+ Founder Community.\n\nGREY Journal ‚Äì Media partner spotlighting modern entrepreneurs (featured on Apple News + Google News).\n\nü§ù Venue Partner\n\nPersona - An online identity verification platform that helps businesses, from any size and industry to collect, verify, and manage user identities throughout a customer lifecycle.

With Cisco AI Pods and Leading LLMs, employees can choose the best model for the job. We‚Äôll close with outcomes from assistants in Sales (GSX), Cisco events (Cisco Live), support, and engineering‚Äîcovering proposal generation, RFP compliance, and bug triage‚Äîand share the patterns to replicate this in your org.\n\nTakeaways\n\t‚Ä¢\tReference architecture for agentic, multi-LLM platforms at enterprise scale\n\t‚Ä¢\tPatterns for reliable, stateful agents using LangGraph\n\t‚Ä¢\tSecurity model with OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange, agent identities, and audit trails\n\t‚Ä¢\tOperating model: registry, governance, and cross-agent reuse\n\t‚Ä¢\tRAG at Scale with Pinecone Vector Database\n\t‚Ä¢\tPractical playbook to move from POC to production with measurable productivity gains",

    "description": "As Agentic AI moves from concept to implementation, it is not just the technology that needs to scale ‚Äî it is also the people. Today, organizations across every industry are being forced to rethink what talent means, how roles evolve, and what it truly takes to be ‚ÄúAI-ready.‚Äù \n\nBut here‚Äôs the problem: while AI product vendors continue to launch capabilities at breakneck speed, their System Integrator (SI) partners and enterprise customers are falling behind on enablement. Most employees don‚Äôt just need to learn new tools ‚Äî they need to reinvent how they work. And yet, training systems are stuck in legacy mode: outdated content, low certification rates (often below 30%), and one-size-fits-all approaches that don't stick. \n\nThis session addresses a critical ‚Äî and often overlooked ‚Äî gap in the AI transformation journey: scaling workforce readiness with the same speed and intentionality as the technology itself. \n\nThis event is a part of #SFTechWeek‚Äîa week of events hosted by VCs and startups to bring together the tech ecosystem.

If the verifier is leaky, exploitable, or miscalibrated, you‚Äôre training on lies. This fireside is a candid, practitioner-level dive with builder who have shipped multiple verifiers across tasks (safety, code, tool use).\n\nWe‚Äôll hit:\n- What a good verifier actually is: pairwise vs scalar scoring, sparse rewards, decomposition etc.\n- Generalization under shift: preventing policy-chasing, leakage, and ‚Äúreward hacking by spec ambiguity.‚Äù\n- Calibration & coverage: thresholds, selective prediction, human-in-the-loop only where it moves expected utility.\n- Sparse reward tasks: how to design verifiers when feedback is naturally scarce - detecting rare successes, using proxy signals without collapsing to spec drift, and tricks like trajectory-level verification or hierarchical reward shaping.\n- If time permits: RL environments and how verifiers are the key.\n\nNon-consensus takes we‚Äôll debate:\n- Verifiers should abstain a lot more (prevent the model from training on the wrong signal)\n- Train/Configure verifiers on artifacts (traces/tests), not just text.\n- Optimize for uncertainty quality, not mean score. \n\nWho should come: folks shipping LLMs, agents, RLVR stacks; anyone who‚Äôs been burned by a ‚Äúgood‚Äù reward model.\n\nLeave with a concrete checklist, sample specs, and a playbook to make your verifier the bottleneck on truth.\n\nThis event is a part of #SFTechWeek‚Äîa week of events hosted by VCs and startups to bring together the tech ecosystem.

    "description": "Wednesday, Oct 87:00pmPTGMTHosted byÀò‚ñøÀò*‚óü*^‚ó°^+5This salon invites discussion on LifeLanguage companies and their use of AI as a force for good in healthcare.\n\nLifeLanguage companies specialize in building new AI models to understand the languages of life‚Äîproteins, RNA, and DNA. These companies differ from traditional biotech in that they investigate these languages not with wet-lab approaches but with GPUs. AlphaFold is a leading example in this nascent space and won the Nobel Prize last year. Since then, many startups have modeled their teams after the AlphaFold team, generating sister models that rearrange protein space to form combinations that would have taken evolution hundreds of millions of years to create. These new rearrangements have special properties for curing human disease, strengthening agriculture, and improving manufacturing.\n\nAt Ecotone, our mission is to pioneer the next frontier: a model we call Hawaiian Diamond, capable of reading the human genome-as-a-first-language. The challenge is that AlphaFold was possible because of 3D protein data (PDB), where each protein structure serves as a spatial scaffold. For DNA, which is an encoded information space, no such training data exists. Our breakthrough is a novel method to create this data by shifting from spatial to functional understanding. We interlace, arrange, and layer genomic outputs to build a functional scaffold‚Äîthe \"Point Cloud Feature\"‚Äîthat assigns meaning to sections of DNA. Hawaiian Diamond, trained on these scaffolds, will directly pinpoint the root causes of disease, generating the GPS coordinates needed by DNA-guided medications (e.g., CRISPRs) to cure all 10,000 genetic diseases. This will improve the lives of approximately 800 million people and begin the process of fully annotating the mysterious, unresolved sections of our DNA.\n\nCome and discuss over champagne and [maybe] oysters at a secret cozy space.  Thanks to our sponsors Columbia University Venture Community (CVC SF) and #SFTechWeek.\n\nFormat: Fireside chat followed by conversation and good vibes.  Location will be made available the day before the event.\n\nThis event is a part of #SFTechWeek‚Äîa week of events hosted by VCs and startups to bring together the tech ecosystem.

It is building the first AI engine for the nervous system, exclusively trained on the world's largest FDA-grade ANS dataset.\n\nWHY IT MATTERS:  \n\nThe ANS regulates every major organ and function in the body. Research shows that 70‚Äì99% of people have some form of autonomic dysfunction, which is the hidden indicator/driver of most of our illnesses‚Äîfrom cardiovascular disease to chronic anxiety/depression‚Äîand is the only proven protocol for mystery illnesses (women‚Äôs health, autoimmune disorders, Long COVID, POTS, among others) where traditional diagnostics using blood panels and scans fail. Yet ANS testing remains the most under-utilized protocol in medicine. Until now, full ANS testing was hidden inside niche specialty clinics. Today, Autonomic Health invites you to a private event to experience the only FDA-approved, non-invasive, full diagnostic of the autonomic nervous system and learn how unlocking the body's operating system will transform healthcare.\n\nWHAT TO EXPECT:  \n\n(1) A fireside chat on why the nervous system is the foundation of preventive care and how AI + wearables are finally unlocking this foundational protocol for the mainstream  \n\n- Dr. Joe Colombo (PhD, DNM, DHS): Considered the ‚Äúfather of the autonomic nervous system,‚Äù Dr Colombo invented the only FDA-approved ANS diagnostic, co-authored the defining medical ANS textbook, and has published 200+ papers  \n\n- Dr. Swamy (MD, FACR): A leading American rheumatologist and founder of Attune Health (Beverly Hills, CA); Clinical Chief at Cedars Sinai; Education Chair at the  American College of Rheumatology.\n\n(2) Live demo of a full ANS test to show how a seamless, non-invasive 15-minute diagnostic can reveal hidden dysfunction long before symptoms or labs appear \n\n(3) Optional complimentary test for a limited number of attendees, with a personalized ANS assessment and recommendations to balance their nervous system, which prevents disease, ensures daily vitality and extends health span.  \n\nPROGRAM:\n\n2:00-2:30 - Check-in\n\n‚Äã2:30-3:30 - Fireside chat + Q&A\n\n‚Äã3:30-3:45 - Live demo of the test\n\n‚Äã3:45-5:00 - Complimentary tests for selected guests\n\nAttendance is by invitation only:  \nJoin us to experience firsthand the future of preventive healthcare‚Äîand why investors see the $100B+ preventive care market as one of the most exciting frontiers of the decade.\n\nThis event is a part of #SFTechWeek‚Äîa week of events hosted by VCs and startups to bring together the tech ecosystem.

This evening is for a curated group of leaders tasked with driving operational excellence in an age of disruption.\n\nIn today's complex enterprises, a significant disconnect often exists between corporate leadership focused on strategy and the on-ground teams handling real-time execution. This gap leads to misaligned software, failed AI adoption, and missed opportunities. As one strategist noted, the most critical missing asset is an \"integrated view from the factory floor to the foxhole\". Legacy systems and siloed data are no longer a stable foundation‚Äîthey are the quickest path to being outmaneuvered.\n\nThis roundtable is a candid, off-the-record discussion on closing these operational gaps. We will explore how bespoke AI transformation‚Äîpowered by embedded engineering talent‚Äîcan bridge the divide between strategy and execution, modernizing legacy systems and unlocking efficiency gains. We believe, as Napoleon demonstrated, that the greatest results come when leaders are \"in the trenches\" with their teams, solving real problems on the ground.\n\nOur discussion will center on tangible strategies for:\n‚Ä¢ Bridging the gap between executive vision and front-line execution.\n‚Ä¢ Leveraging custom AI for legacy modernization, internal tooling, and enhanced operational visibility.\n‚Ä¢ Deploying agile engineering teams that embed with your staff to drive adoption and deliver practical, iterative solutions, mirroring the successful Forward Deployed Engineer (FDE) model.\n\nWho Should Attend?\n\nThis is an invite-only event for VPs, Directors, and C-Suite executives from enterprise and mid-market companies ($100M+ revenue). If you lead teams in complex, operations-heavy environments and are responsible for driving AI strategy and transformation, we want you in the room.\n\nWhat to Expect\n‚Ä¢ Candid Conversation: A private discussion with a small group of industry leaders who understand that your status quo is the losing state.\n\n‚Ä¢ Premium Experience: A selection of world-class cigars and top-shelf spirits.\n\n‚Ä¢ High-Caliber Networking: Connect with peers who, like you, are shaping the narrative arc of their companies from challenge to greatness.\n\nThis is your opportunity to forge the path to operational leadership. Spaces are extremely limited to ensure a valuable and intimate conversation.\n\nThis event is a part of #LATechWeek‚Äîa week of events hosted by VCs and startups to bring together the tech ecosystem.

    "description": "üöÄ Spreadsheets are fine‚Ä¶ if you like drowning. But investors (and your sanity) demand better. \n\n‚ÄãAs part of SF Tech Week, Startup Intros, BridgeBank & ScaleSpark are hosting a panel that gets real about startup finances. We‚Äôll talk about automating the grunt work, the alternative financing options that actually exist beyond the tired ‚Äúbootstrap vs. VC‚Äù narrative, and why investors are done with vanity metrics and demand real-time numbers they can trust.\n\n‚ÄãIf you‚Äôre serious about building a company that can survive the lean years and pass investor scrutiny, skip the fluff and join us.\n\nPanelists:\n\nTejal Shah, VP Investment Banking, US Capital Global\nTejal Shah brings to US Capital Global a strong background in financial services and asset management, along with expertise in capital raising and fostering high-value relationships with VIP clients. Ms. Shah‚Äôs career commenced at Merrill Lynch and Bank of America as a Wealth Manager and then left to co-founded Peninsula Wealth, a registered independent wealth management firm where she successfully oversaw $400 million in asset.\n\nWith a decade of serial entrepreneurial experience in early-stage startups, Ms. Shah has successfully conceptualized, funded, launched, and scaled multiple businesses. Her profound grasp of the startup landscape encompasses business development, fundraising, and operations.\n\nBefore her tenure at US Capital Global, Ms. Shah served as a limited partner at Refactor Capital and Halogen Ventures, both instrumental in evaluating startups for potential VC investments and offering strategic advice. Notably, she steered 555 Comic Co in San Francisco as COO, securing $6.1 million in venture capital. Her first startup was KidAdmit, pioneering venture capital funding in the early education market backed by some of the most well known venture capital firms including SV Angel, K9 Ventures, Urban Innovation Fund to name a few.\n\nMs. Shah‚Äôs academic background includes a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Rochester, NY and started her career in technical roles in Product Design for Ford Motor Company, medical devices, and air pollution control systems.\n\nSerge Amouzou, CEO & Founder, Verza\nI'm all-in on Verza, an AI-powered financial co-pilot for the creator economy. We're solving the critical 'deal side' problem for creators‚Äîfrom smart contract management and accelerated payments to effortless tax prep and banking. In just a month and a half, Verza has shipped its MVP and gained early adoption from paying users, including top creators globally. We're building a revenue-driven, capital-efficient business designed for rapid scale.\n\nMy journey to Verza began with Datatrixs, an AI insights platform, where valuable market learnings led to this focused pivot. Before that, I founded the FinTech company Delect, earning BBJ CEO of the Year in 2017 for my innovative work in streamlining restaurant operations and significantly increasing waitstaff earnings.\n\n‚Äãüîë What you‚Äôll take away:\n\n‚ÄãFunding options that go beyond bootstrapping and can help you get to the next raise without dilution.\n\n‚ÄãHow to automate your financial ops so you can get the real-time numbers you need and investors want.\n\n‚ÄãStrategies to move off spreadsheets and onto automation without losing your sanity (or your company).\n\n‚Äãüë• Who should attend:\n\n‚ÄãFounders gearing up for the next raise.\n\n‚ÄãOperators and finance leads who want smarter systems, not more chaos.\n\n‚ÄãStartup teams‚Äô sick of busywork and bad metrics.\n\n‚ÄãFinance and Ops teams who want to stop scrubbing data and start using real-time data strategically. \n\n‚ÄãScaleSpark Founded by operators who've lived the startup chaos. They install your SparkStack so you can get back to building, hiring, and leading because you weren't funded to build your back office.\n\n‚ÄãBridgeBank is Silicon Valley's original startup bank. From pre-revenue to IPO, they've backed bold entrepreneurs with sophisticated financing and an understanding that growth takes time.\n\n‚ÄãStartup Intros is a media and intelligence platform that enables founders to connect with the right investors through warm introductions, signal-driven events, and a trusted email newsletter. Incubated at Context VC, we are on a mission to democratize funding and make the ecosystem more efficient.\n\n‚ÄãContext Ventures is an early-stage venture firm that backs leaders who seek context. We invest early, move fast, and stay hands-on to help transformative companies take root and grow, with 90% of our capital going to military veteran founders.\n\nThis event is a part of #SFTechWeek‚Äîa week of events hosted by VCs and startups to bring together the tech ecosystem.

Think polished floors, startup lore, and the kind of place where ‚Äúall-in‚Äù could mean your next round.\n\n‚Äã*****Drinks & Snacks Included!*****\n\n-----------\nCHOOSE YOUR FLAVOR:\n‚ÄãAt the table (or around it), you‚Äôve got three ways to play:\n-----------\n‚Äã- 10c/20c No-Limit Hold ‚ÄôEm ‚Äî for the poker-curious\n- ‚Äã1/1 No-Limit Hold ‚ÄôEm ‚Äî light sparring, the warm-up ring.\n‚Äã- 5/5 No-Limit Hold ‚ÄôEm ‚Äî where the sharks circle and the pots get real.\n‚Äã- Drinks & Socializing ‚Äî because sometimes the best move is sitting back with a whiskey and letting others show their tells.\n\n-----------\n‚ÄãWho Belongs Here\n-----------\n‚ÄãFounders who‚Äôve raised $1M+ (you‚Äôve proven you can ante up).\n‚ÄãInvestors & LPs who know that real deal flow happens after-hours.\n‚ÄãAnyone who understands that poker is about character, risk, and nerve.\n‚ÄãWhy Show Up?\n\n‚ÄãBecause you‚Äôll learn more about someone‚Äôs true game in two hours here than in twenty pitch meetings. Because this is AngelList + the Spice King ‚Äî two brands that don‚Äôt exactly do ‚Äúcasual.‚Äù And because in this room, even a losing hand might win you your next deal.\n\n-----------\n‚ÄãThe Ground Rules\n-----------\n‚ÄãNo sneaking in: This is badged-in, ID-checked, guest-list-only. If you‚Äôre not approved, you‚Äôre not crossing that lobby.\n\n‚ÄãRespect the seat: Take a spot, then ghost? You‚Äôll be exiled from the Spice King‚Äôs future events. No second chances.\n\n‚ÄãSpecial guests: Each night will feature surprise players ‚Äî the kind who don‚Äôt just play the game, they change it.\n\n‚ÄãSeats are scarce. The vibe is sharp. The room is swank.\n\n‚Äã‚Äî Spice King of Zanzibar\nhttps://lu.ma/spicekingofzanzibar\n\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî\nRSVP TO OTHER POKER NIGHTS DURING TECHWEEK!\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî\nRSVP TO OTHER POKER NIGHTS DURING TECHWEEK!\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî\nMon Oct 6 - https://partiful.com/e/2s9AgbnP19mlXLQ4zi3C\nTue Oct 7 - https://partiful.com/e/60mj0wQK2dFvfD32WS7A\nWed Oct 8 - https://partiful.com/e/4lctWXCytcey9e4RyVtM\nFri Oct 10 - https://partiful.com/e/GDPbUkJbQoOg06yzEaKR\nSat Oct 11 - https://partiful.com/e/qXfdoYoNqdhuEGvouM64\n\n-----------\nThis event is a part of #SFTechWeek‚Äîa week of events hosted by VCs and startups to bring together the tech ecosystem.

She was hit by a car driver (AKA \"Death Monster\") which broke both her legs simultaneously, while she was going to Ocean Beach, to catch the Men's World Surf Competition of American OG Kelly Slater vs rising Brazilian superstar Gabriel Medina. She was released from the hospital on 11/11/11, bionic, with a titanium right leg. Luckily, Fennel fully recovered from the crash, and was able to reproduce a child.\n\nIn 2020, Fennel created D5WR when schools closed during COVID for 2 years. \"In the dark shadow of death*\", Fennel and her (then 7 YO) son began going to the beach park together seeking life, energy, and observation-based learning flow state, as school. D5WR campaigned tirelessly to unlock the path for all, forever, to create health for future generations, and particularly for Black & broke folks living in the city. Health = Wealth.\n\nWe go hard to clear our minds and ideate. We keep going.

As well as the need for grassroots action, community empowerment, and the deep connection between environmental health and social well-being, as exemplified by the powerful legacy of the Green Belt Movement's founder, Wangarƒ© Maathai, in Kenya. \n\nD5WR is proud to share our core beloved city green pathway with you and yours.

    "description": "We stand at civilization's most consequential threshold: the emergence of artificial superintelligence and technologies that may fundamentally alter human cognition itself.\n\nJoin us for a unique 60-minute conversation between two extraordinary minds exploring intelligence, existential risk, and the future of humanity:\n\nüéì Nick Bostrom ‚Äî Oxford philosopher, author of the bestselling book Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies, and founding director of the Future of Humanity Institute. His work on existential risk, the simulation hypothesis, and AI governance has shaped how the world's leading institutions think about transformative technology.\n\nüèÜ Jonas von Essen ‚Äî 2X World Memory Champion, co-founder of memoryOS, and holder of multiple world records, including memorizing 100,000 digits of Pi. From game show champion (Jeopardy!, Who Wants to Be a Millionaire) to neurotechnology entrepreneur, Jonas represents the practical frontier of human cognitive enhancement.\n\nWhat We'll Explore: üîç\n\n‚è∞ What are the true existential risks of ASI?\nüß¨ Risks involved with BMIs having read AND write access to all regions of the brain (injection of false memories and human hacking)\nüéØ What should founders, builders, and investors understand now to be on the right side of history?\nüí¨ Q&A with the audience\n\nThis is not a debate about gadgets or buzzwords. It is a deep, unsparing exploration of where intelligence itself is heading ‚Äî and whether we are prepared.\n\nAudience:\n\nThis session is curated for investors, founders, and technologists who are building at the edge of AI, neurotech, and human‚Äìmachine symbiosis. The conversation promises both inspiration and caution: a rare chance to think about the future with clarity, ambition, and urgency.\n\n--\n\nThis event is a part of #SFTechWeek‚Äîa week of events hosted by VCs and startups to bring together the tech ecosystem.

    "description": "From calculator watches to Google Glass, humanity has spent decades trying to merge technology with the body. Some designs became icons. Most ended up in drawers.\n\nMuseum of Wearables Evolution is a one-night immersive installation at the buzzy new World Flagship Store, iconically located on Union Square. We are thrilled to be partnering with World ID, founded by Sam Altman. Our pop-up exhibit will be sharing their space with the World Orb, the innovative and NVIDIA-powered biometric screening device that distinguishes humans from AI.\n\nThis exclusive Taya and Oasis Collective event traces the history of wearable tech: from retro gadgets and failed futures to jewelry that has carried hidden meaning for centuries. Each artifact will be displayed with museum-style plaques, charting what promised to be the future and why it didn‚Äôt last.\n\nThe exhibition has sneak peeks of Taya - an AI-powered pendant designed as jewelry first, technology second. It‚Äôs our answer to the question: what if wearable tech finally passed the ‚Äúdead battery test‚Äù?\n\nSign up for the waitlist here: tayanecklace.com\n\nThis event is for founders, investors, designers, and the Tech Week community who care about the intersection of hardware, AI, and culture. Join us to explore the lineage of wearables and see some sneak peeks.\n\nThis event is a part of #SFTechWeek‚Äîa week of events hosted by VCs and startups to bring together the tech ecosystem.

During Techweek, every night Sunday through Saturday, I‚Äôm hosting a private poker/founders lounge inside the sleek offices of AngelList. Yes, you read that right: poker in the house that built modern startup investing.\n\n‚ÄãI‚Äôve teamed up with AngelList because there‚Äôs no better backdrop for big bets and bold bluffs. Think polished floors, startup lore, and the kind of place where ‚Äúall-in‚Äù could mean your next round.\n\n‚Äã*****Drinks & Snacks Included!*****\n\n-----------\nCHOOSE YOUR FLAVOR:\n‚ÄãAt the table (or around it), you‚Äôve got three ways to play:\n-----------\n‚Äã- 10c/20c No-Limit Hold ‚ÄôEm ‚Äî for the poker-curious\n- ‚Äã1/1 No-Limit Hold ‚ÄôEm ‚Äî light sparring, the warm-up ring.\n‚Äã- 5/5 No-Limit Hold ‚ÄôEm ‚Äî where the sharks circle and the pots get real.\n‚Äã- Drinks & Socializing ‚Äî because sometimes the best move is sitting back with a whiskey and letting others show their tells.\n\n-----------\n‚ÄãWho Belongs Here\n-----------\n‚ÄãFounders who‚Äôve raised $1M+ (you‚Äôve proven you can ante up).\n‚ÄãInvestors & LPs who know that real deal flow happens after-hours.\n‚ÄãAnyone who understands that poker is about character, risk, and nerve.\n‚ÄãWhy Show Up?\n\n‚ÄãBecause you‚Äôll learn more about someone‚Äôs true game in two hours here than in twenty pitch meetings. Because this is AngelList + the Spice King ‚Äî two brands that don‚Äôt exactly do ‚Äúcasual.‚Äù And because in this room, even a losing hand might win you your next deal.\n\n-----------\n‚ÄãThe Ground Rules\n-----------\n‚ÄãNo sneaking in: This is badged-in, ID-checked, guest-list-only. If you‚Äôre not approved, you‚Äôre not crossing that lobby.\n\n‚ÄãRespect the seat: Take a spot, then ghost? You‚Äôll be exiled from the Spice King‚Äôs future events. No second chances.\n\n‚ÄãSpecial guests: Each night will feature surprise players ‚Äî the kind who don‚Äôt just play the game, they change it.\n\n‚ÄãSeats are scarce. The vibe is sharp.
