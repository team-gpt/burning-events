    "description": "Please join us for the a16z speedrun AI Faire, featuring the hottest AI B2B startups coming out of the last 5 batches. You'll have the opportunity to meet dozens of founders from a16z speedrun's past and present and learn about (and demo!) the AI tools they're building.\n\nThis is for executives looking to adopt new tech at their company.\n\nThere is no planned programming - this is for you to walk around and see AI demos from early-stage founders in a casual environment. Entry times will be staggered. Please provide your preferred entry time upon application to attend. We will confirm with an email what your entry time is for the event.\n\nNote: Investors will automatically be put into the 3pm-5pm time slot. \n\na16z speedrun is Andreessen Horowitz's program to invest in, and help, new startups. We run a 2x/year program that spans 12 weeks, with dozens of startups working out of a16z’s offices in SF and LA. So far we've invested in over 150 startups with $180M+ in capital deployed.\n\nDue to capacity constraints, we will not be able to accommodate every guest that applies. Please wait to see \"you're on the list\" before you make plans to attend. Thank you for understanding.\n\nWe look forward to hosting you!\n\nThis event is a part of #SFTechWeek—a week of events hosted by VCs and startups to bring together the tech ecosystem.

Engage in conversations with fellow innovators, entrepreneurs, and our experienced US team.\n\nExperience the excitement of a live broadcast of our acclaimed Tech Law Talks podcast (https://reedsmithtech.podbean.com/), where we’ll explore one of the most urgent debates of our era: Should AI be regulated now, or are we moving too fast? Settle in and be part of a dynamic conversation that delves into the complex relationship between innovation and regulation in the world of artificial intelligence. Our panel will discuss whether early regulation is a safeguard against potential disasters or a barrier that could stifle groundbreaking progress.  Topics will include:\n\n• Kickoff: “AI is moving faster than law — should we regulate now?”\n• Debate: Innovation vs. guardrails (pros/cons).\n• Case studies: A few recent controversies (deepfakes, AI bias, copyright fights).\n• Ethics & power: What should AI never do? Who decides?\n• Forecast: Where is regulation most likely to land, and what does it mean for builders and investors?\n• Audience Q&A / poll: Do you want more or less AI regulation right now?\n\nWhether you’re passionate about AI, skeptical of its promises, or simply curious about where technology is headed, this event is your opportunity to join the discussion, share your thoughts, and connect with others who are equally engaged in the future of innovation.\n\nWe look forward to welcoming you for an evening of insight, connection, and celebration.\n\nThis event is a part of #SFTechWeek—a week of events hosted by VCs and startups to bring together the tech ecosystem.

Whether you’re rallying your team through change, aligning executives on a bold vision, or persuading investors, this dynamic workshop goes beyond structure and slides. During this two-hour workshop Sylvia Bargellini (Change Management Workshop Facilitator) will facilitate activities guiding how to communicate with clarity, confidence, and impact by blending strategic storytelling with the empathy and adaptability that define standout leaders.\n\n​Although this workshop is designed for founders and tech leaders who are usually talking with and pitching to investors, this session will help anyone working on developing their comfort and confidence in communication.\n\nTopics include:\n\n​- Command Any Room – Strengthen your presence with body language and vocal power, while using emotional intelligence to read and respond to unspoken cues.​\n\n- Master Tech-Tuned Storytelling – Translate complex ideas into compelling narratives that resonate emotionally and intellectually, turning data into conviction.\n\n- ​Persuade with Precision – Adapt your message on the fly, whether speaking to engineers, executives, or investors—because persuasion isn’t one-size-fits-all.\n\n- ​Drive Decisions, Not Just Dialogue – Create urgency, build credibility, and turn presentations into action by aligning your pitch with your audience’s motivations and concerns.\n\n​The best communicators don’t just inform—they inspire.

It’s your always-on SRE copilot that automates root cause analysis and identifies patterns that drive continuous improvement—trusted by hundreds of companies like LinkedIn, NVIDIA, Replit, Elastic, Canva, Clay, Tripadvisor, and Shell.\n\nAbout Elastic\n\nElastic, the Search AI Company, integrates its deep expertise in search technology with artificial intelligence to help everyone transform all of their data into answers, actions, and outcomes. Elastic's Search AI Platform — the foundation for its search, observability, and security solutions — is used by thousands of companies, including more than 50% of the Fortune 500. Learn more at elastic.co.\n\nAbout Endor Labs\n\nEndor Labs is an application security platform created by practitioners, academics, and builders who are experts in software supply chain security. We believe the biggest problem in AppSec today is that fixing risk is too hard—because security and development teams work differently. And now with AI generating more code than ever, that gap is only growing. Endor Labs bridges it by showing security teams what’s actually exploitable and what could break if you make a change. That way, you can have a smart conversation with developers about what to fix now, fix later, or fix never.\n\n​​​​​​​Photography Disclaimer: Please note that filming/photography is taking place at the event for promotional and archival purposes. These images will be used by Rootly to share news about the event and will appear on the Rootly website and may appear on our social media.

It gives you practical strategies, real examples, and an 18 element framework that covers vision, strategy, and execution.\n\nWhy I wrote it:\n\t•\tTo share lessons from the Fortune 100 and startup trenches\n\t•\tTo distill the secret sauce behind iconic tech brands\n\t•\tTo bring you the wisdom of leaders who built them\n\nWhat you will learn:\n\t•\tPosition with precision so your value is unmistakably clear\n\t•\tUse story to connect before the rational pitch even begins\n\t•\tBuild consistency across every touchpoint so trust compounds\n\nWho it is for:\n\t•\tStartup founders who need clarity on priorities and next steps when it matters most\n\t•\tMarketing executives who want a timely gut check to align teams and accelerate growth\n\nWhat early readers say:\n\n“Too many startups try to be all things to all people. The Marketing Plan for Tech Startups shows why that fails and offers practical advice to acquire customers and scale growth. I’m calling all founders: this is a must-read.”\n– Jeanine Banks, Investor and VP of Developer X, Google\n\n“Justyna Bak reframes milestones as moments to validate assumptions and recalibrate risks. That perspective alone can save startups months of wasted effort.”\nSusan Schramm, Founder, Go-to-Market Impact\n\n“As a startup CMO, this framework was a timely gut check. It helped me tie up loose ends and drive alignment so the team could focus on what really matters.”\n– Scott Buchanan, CMO, Stacklok\n\n“The strongest, most lasting customer loyalty starts with a company’s own identity. This book makes that path clear.”\n– Filippo Rocca, CEO, Subbyx\n\nCome for the launch and leave with a plan you can use immediately.\n\nThe exact location in FiDi SF will be revealed closer to the event.\n\nPreorder now and pick up your copy at the event:\n👉 https://marketingwithjustyna.gumroad.com/l/MARKETINGPLAN",

    "description": "Let’s talk about what’s actually working in 2025.\n\n​You’re spending on digital ads. You’re personalizing outbound. You’re running Account-Based Marketing (ABM) campaigns with a dozen touchpoints — but your leads still ghost, your deals stall, and your marketing feels… forgettable.\n\n​Meanwhile, companies hosting just one thoughtful, in-person event are closing six-figure deals in weeks. Why? Because IRL is outperforming every other marketing channel — and no one’s talking about it.\n\n​This event is for the people behind the events:\n\n​➡️ Event marketers trying to prove ROI\n\n​➡️ Community builders looking to grow and retain the right members\n\n​➡️ Event producers juggling vibes and budgets\n\n​➡️ Heads of marketing who are finally waking up to how powerful in-person connection can be\n\n​We’re going deep on how top companies are flipping their growth strategies by treating experiences like revenue engines — not just brand plays.\n\n​What You’ll Learn:\n​WTF is “IRL-as-ABM” and why it’s changing B2B marketing as we know it\n\n​Real examples of events that drove pipeline, not just vibes\n\n​How leading brands structure event-led funnels that turn guests into deals\n\n​Tactical breakdowns: targeting, personalization, follow-up, budget allocation\n\n​What to measure, what to skip, and how to make the case to your CRO\n\n​Behind-the-scenes playbooks from founders, heads of events, and marketers at breakout companies\n\n​Who’s Speaking:\nDiana Nicholas - Head of Event Marketing @ Pilot\nJon Stein - Co-Founder @ Alchemy Springs\nTeddy Kramer - Founder @ NEON\n\n​Expect CROs, heads of growth, and event leads from some of the most innovative tech brands in SF.\n\n​\n\n​Why You Can’t Miss This:\n​There are dozens of happy hours this week.\n\n​There are very few conversations that will change the way you work.\n\n​This event is built for the people driving Tech Week behind the scenes — the operators, producers, and community strategists who know that the best marketing is felt, not just seen.\n\n​You’ll leave with new connections, tactical ideas you can use next week, and a powerful reminder:\n\n​✨ Events don’t just support your growth strategy — they are your growth strategy. ✨\n\n​\n\n​Format:\n​5:30 PM — Arrival & Welcome Drinks\n\n​6:00 PM — Panel + Live Q&A\n\n​7:00 PM — Mixer, bites, and big ideas with great people\n\n​8:30 PM — Close\n\n​Who Should Come:\n​Event marketers and producers at early- to growth-stage startups\n\n​Founders and operators investing in IRL engagement\n\n​Community managers and heads of CX/brand\n\n​Anyone planning events who wants to turn energy into pipeline\n\n​RSVP Now — Capacity Is Limited\n​We’re keeping this tight, intentional, and worth your time.\n\n​The room will be full of people you actually want to meet.\n\n​Request your invite now to lock in your spot.\n\nThis event is a part of #SFTechWeek—a week of events hosted by VCs and startups to bring together the tech ecosystem.

Founders knew what they were building, users knew what they were getting, and the tension to PMF was in combining the right data and insights. But what happens when products are no longer deterministic? What changes when the product you build is determined by the user, is ever-evolving, and produces rapidly diffusing data points? \n\nIn this sit-down with Nick Ryder (VP Research, Foundations @ OpenAI), Elizabeth Weil (GP @ Scribble, early executive @ Twitter), and other top ai researchers/operators, we'll talk about the new paradigm of startup development and break down how the startup funnel - from engineering to growth to marketing to finance...and even team culture - will radically and rapidly shift in the best AI startups.  \n\nThis event is a part of #SFTechWeek—a week of events hosted by VCs and startups to bring together the tech ecosystem.

During Techweek, every night Sunday through Saturday, I’m hosting a private poker/founders lounge inside the sleek offices of AngelList. Yes, you read that right: poker in the house that built modern startup investing.\n\n​I’ve teamed up with AngelList because there’s no better backdrop for big bets and bold bluffs. Think polished floors, startup lore, and the kind of place where “all-in” could mean your next round.\n\n​*****Drinks & Snacks Included!*****\n\n-----------\nCHOOSE YOUR FLAVOR:\n​At the table (or around it), you’ve got three ways to play:\n-----------\n​- 10c/20c No-Limit Hold ’Em — for the poker-curious\n- ​1/1 No-Limit Hold ’Em — light sparring, the warm-up ring.\n​- 5/5 No-Limit Hold ’Em — where the sharks circle and the pots get real.\n​- Drinks & Socializing — because sometimes the best move is sitting back with a whiskey and letting others show their tells.\n\n-----------\n​Who Belongs Here\n-----------\n​Founders who’ve raised $1M+ (you’ve proven you can ante up).\n​Investors & LPs who know that real deal flow happens after-hours.\n​Anyone who understands that poker is about character, risk, and nerve.\n​Why Show Up?\n\n​Because you’ll learn more about someone’s true game in two hours here than in twenty pitch meetings. Because this is AngelList + the Spice King — two brands that don’t exactly do “casual.” And because in this room, even a losing hand might win you your next deal.\n\n-----------\n​The Ground Rules\n-----------\n​No sneaking in: This is badged-in, ID-checked, guest-list-only. If you’re not approved, you’re not crossing that lobby.\n\n​Respect the seat: Take a spot, then ghost? You’ll be exiled from the Spice King’s future events. No second chances.\n\n​Special guests: Each night will feature surprise players — the kind who don’t just play the game, they change it.\n\n​Seats are scarce. The vibe is sharp. The room is swank.\n\n​— Spice King of Zanzibar\nhttps://lu.ma/spicekingofzanzibar\n\n———\nRSVP TO OTHER POKER NIGHTS DURING TECHWEEK!\n———\n———\nRSVP TO OTHER POKER NIGHTS DURING TECHWEEK!\n———\nTue Oct 7 - https://partiful.com/e/60mj0wQK2dFvfD32WS7A\nWed Oct 8 - https://partiful.com/e/4lctWXCytcey9e4RyVtM\nThu Oct 9 - https://partiful.com/e/4ZomYSAK9jE18kGcZez6\nFri Oct 10 - https://partiful.com/e/GDPbUkJbQoOg06yzEaKR\nSat Oct 11 - https://partiful.com/e/qXfdoYoNqdhuEGvouM64\n\n-----------\nThis event is a part of #SFTechWeek—a week of events hosted by VCs and startups to bring together the tech ecosystem.

Curated pace groups (seed jog, Series-A surge), KPI chalk stops, and a finish-line demo alley with espresso + cold brew keep it tight and high-signal.

The event kicks off with a high-impact panel titled \"Legacy Redefined: Reinvention at the Peak of Power\" featuring a curated lineup of luminary speakers — including ex-CEOs, former policymakers, creative founders, and senior educators — who’ve successfully pivoted into legacy-building roles.\n\nFollowing the panel, attendees will join guided breakout sprints (virtual and in-person pods) where they’ll design their next chapter using AI-assisted templates and a custom-designed legacy workbook. In the final hour, select participants can pitch or demo what they’re launching next — whether it’s a venture, book, initiative, or personal project — with feedback from impact investors, legacy builders, and transition coaches.\n\nWhat makes it special:\nIt’s more than a conversation — it’s a transition container. Attendees leave with a personal roadmap for the next 3–6 months of their legacy, practical feedback from experts, and curated connections with fellow high-caliber leaders also in reinvention.\n\nThis event is a part of #SFTechWeek—a week of events hosted by VCs and startups to bring together the tech ecosystem.

It's about what happens after you've built something extraordinary, taken it public, and stepped back to ask: \"What now?\"\nWhat you'll discover:\n\nThe psychological shift from building to exiting—and why success can feel surprisingly hollow\nHow to navigate identity beyond your company when you ARE the company\nThe real story behind IPO decisions, timing, and what founders wish they'd known\nWhy some exits feel like victories while others feel like endings\nThe art of knowing when to hold on and when to let go\n\nThis conversation dives deep into the parts of the founder journey rarely discussed: the loneliness of major decisions, the weight of shareholder expectations, and the strange experience of watching your life's work become someone else's responsibility.\nIf you're tired of the typical founder fairy tales and want the unvarnished truth about what it takes—and what it costs—to build companies that outlive their creators, this conversation is for you.\n\nFor founders who've moved beyond survival mode and want to understand what mastery actually looks like.\n\nThis event is graciously being sponsored by: \nFounderNexus-Community for 2x, venture scale founders, where we help triple your odds. This is a global scale community for founders looking to level up their skills. Learn more at www.foundernexus.com\n\nWeWorks.

Furthermore, they are woefully inadequate from a security and privacy standpoint: one compromised agent can leak proprietary models, violate data policies, or trigger cascading system failures.\n\nIn this panel discussion, our experts will discuss the complexities of deploying (and scaling) enterprise AI and agents from business, technical, and operational perspectives, including empowering agents with payments and identity while ensuring broader AI security and compliance.\n\nThis session is for enterprise leaders, operators, and builders who are collectively navigating the realities of implementing AI into their company workflows and achieving measurable results. \n\nAgenda: \n  - 30 minute panel discussion\n  - 10 minute Q&A \n  - Casual mingling and snacking\n\nMeet Our Panel:\n  - Dr. Raluca Ada Popa: Head of Security & Privacy Research at Google DeepMind; Computer security professor at University of California-Berkeley\n  - Amir Sarhangi: CEO + Founder of Skyfire (an a16z-funded company); Former VP of Product and Services at Ripple\n  - Aaron Fulkerson: CEO of OPAQUE; Former VP and General Manager at ServiceNow\n\nEvent Details:\n  - Date: October 7, 2025 | 11:30 AM - 1:30 PM (SF Tech Week)\n  - Location: San Francisco, CA (address shared with accepted guests only)\n  - Hosted by OPAQUE and Skyfire\n\nThis event is a part of #SFTechWeek—a week of events hosted by VCs and startups to bring together the tech ecosystem.

    "description": "The Human Side of AI and Storytelling \nWhat Tech Can Learn from Entertainment About Engaging and Retaining Audiences\n\nIn a world where AI is reshaping how we create and consume content, the human element is more critical than ever. This session explores what tech leaders can learn from entertainment about the power of storytelling to drive engagement and retention—whether in learning, marketing, or product design. We’ll look at where AI adds value, where human creativity is irreplaceable, and how to bridge creative and technical mindsets to build experiences that truly connect.\n\nSpeakers\n\nLinda Simensky is a renowned leader in animation and storytelling. Most recently, she was Head of Animation and Scripted Content at Duolingo, where she expanded the company’s character-driven stories and helped grow its hit Duolingo Stories product. Before Duolingo, she served as Head of Children’s Content at PBS, Senior Vice President of Original Animation at Cartoon Network (overseeing The Powerpuff Girls), and helped launch Nickelodeon’s pioneering animation slate, including Rugrats, Doug, Rocko’s Modern Life, and Hey Arnold! She is currently working on a book about her adventures in animation while teaching at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nJackie Canino is the Chief Content Office at Xapa, where she leads content strategy, curriculum development, and narrative design. With over 15 years of experience in television, gaming, and interactive media, she specializes in creating engaging learning experiences that blend storytelling with professional and personal development.\n\nThis event is a part of #SFTechWeek—a week of events hosted by VCs and startups to bring together the tech ecosystem.

No agenda other than to walk and talk, networking with other like-minded women and woman-identifying founders and funders in the startup ecosystem (outside of the usual, noisy bar atmosphere).  We look forward to engaging conversations while taking in some fresh air!\n\n​​Additional details:\n\n​​Meet up: You will need to find the elevators/escalators to the 4th level or ride the gondola up (which is free but sometimes has a line). We’ll meet up near the amphitheater stage on the southwest end of the park near 2nd Street—we’ll gather there and then set off on the walking path around 2:45.\n\n​​​More details on the park layout (which will show where you can find elevators/escalators on the ground level): https://www.tjpa.org/salesforce-transit-center/salesforce-park\n\n​​​​About the host:\n\n​​​​Aravinda Seshadri is the Founding Partner of Venturous Counsel, a uniquely mission-driven firm dedicated to representing underestimated startups, investors and values-aligned companies. As a part of that work, she actively maintains and expands her network of diverse-led law firms and diverse attorneys to whom she can refer startups and investors needing the right legal partner.  She has initiated a series of Diversity Referral nights in the SF Bay Area, organized to give diverse lawyers in various specialty areas the opportunity to present their practices to other attorneys, particularly those in large law firms, in-house and government positions, to broaden their networks and facilitate referring work to these diverse attorneys.\n\n​​​​Aravinda has been the committee chair of the Solo/Small Firms committee of the Asian American Bar Association of the Greater Bay Area for 3 consecutive years, as well as a Forum Ventures mentor.  She also participates in various technology and legal forums that focus on women and women of color, advising accelerators with diverse cohorts, helping to judge startup pitch events at UC Law and her firm works with the UC Law Startup Legal Garage Clinic to provide pro bono services to aligned startups along with training for law students.\n\n​​​​Aravinda has been named a Super Lawyers Rising Star for 7 consecutive years. She was previously a Partner at Silicon Legal Strategy in San Francisco. Before that, she was a corporate associate in the startup practice of Hogan Lovells in Palo Alto. She started her career in Orrick’s Emerging Companies Group in Menlo Park.  Aravinda received her law degree with distinction from Stanford Law School and her undergraduate degree with honors in Language and Mind from New York University.\n\n​Make sure to come early for a small giveaway to the first 10 attendees!\n\n​​By registering, you agree that Venturous Counsel can email you about important events, key strategic insights and relevant updates.\n\nThis event is a part of #SFTechWeek—a week of events hosted by VCs and startups to bring together the tech ecosystem.

    "description": "Christine Heckart, CEO and founder of Xapa, has held executive roles at Brocade, Cisco, and Microsoft. She now leads Xapa, an AI-powered platform that helps teams build essential soft skills like empathy, adaptability, and self-awareness.\n\n\nAI will change what we do at work, but it may also impact the 'why' of work - purpose, growth, impact, and meaning. This session dives into the 150-year history of the changing ‘why’ of work (and marriage, too!), including how the unprecedented uncertainty from AI and macroeconomic stressors is rocking our boats and ushering in a new era of growth through transformational change.  As AI takes over task execution, the real value of human workers lies elsewhere in creating meaning, navigating ambiguity, fostering alignment, and leading through uncertainty. But how do we get through this transformation, and what, specifically, is on the other side?\nWe’ll discuss how organizations can navigate the massive disruption of AI adoption and ultimately redefine, reinvent, and reimagine “work.”\n\nThis event is a part of #SFTechWeek—a week of events hosted by VCs and startups to bring together the tech ecosystem.

Bring your wins, scars, and questions.\n\nWe’re explicitly looking to discuss the “beyond individual contributor” side: scalable code changes, design governance, quality gates, migration guardrails, and project context management. On top of that, we’ll cover LLM-aware practices at the org level. So if this is your scope of responsibility/interest, you’ll feel at home.\nBonus: After the official tech presentations - we’re going to celebrate VirtusLab’s 15-year anniversary - come raise a toast!

Model Context Protocols (MCPs) are emerging as a standard solution, and companies building production implementations are discovering surprising insights.\n\nThis fireside chat brings together Jon Dahl (Co-founder and CEO, Mux) and Michael Grinich (Founder and CEO, WorkOS)—two technical founders who have shipped production MCP integrations. Mux discovered that years of focus on video infrastructure had created valuable primitives that were the perfect AI building blocks such as storyboard extraction for content moderation, while WorkOS solved the enterprise authentication challenges essential for secure deployments.\n\nBoth saw a broader pattern: established API businesses often have infrastructure that becomes incredibly valuable for AI workflows, even when not originally designed for that purpose. This raises questions about how companies should evaluate existing assets for AI integration.\n\nExpect a candid conversation about technical realities, integration speed, and strategic considerations.

The old promises are gone—Gen Z, AI, and new org models are reshaping careers, companies, and what it means to thrive. Instead of clinging to outdated systems, we’ll explore:\n\n* How decision-making power in work is being redistributed (from employers to workers, from credentials to skills to tasks, from tenure to outcomes).\n* What models of learning, work, and career readiness are emerging—and which are failing.\n* The role technology and human skills play in shaping the next era of employment.\n\n💫 Whether you’re an early career professional, HR or L&D leader, investor, philanthropist, or founder — if you care about reimagining work where human skills and purpose matter, this conversation is for you!\n\n Join us to explore the new rules of the game.",

Join us for an evening exploring how PostgreSQL and DuckDB work better together!\n\nWe'll feature talks on integrating DuckDB with existing PostgreSQL workflows, scaling analytics workloads, combining both tools for data engineering use cases, and more. The evening will include technical talks, networking, and discussions about the future of OLAP and OLTP working in harmony – co-hosted by MotherDuck and Dagster!\n\nAgenda: \n\n**Just use Postgres (and DuckDB)**\n\nThe most effective data stacks are often the simplest. This talk demonstrates how combining Postgres and DuckDB creates an elegant and robust platform, freeing you to focus on solving customer problems instead of wrestling with infrastructure.\n\npresented by Jacob Matson, Developer Advocate @ MotherDuck\n\n**Stop Fighting Your Data Platform: Modern Orchestration for High-Velocity Teams**\n\nThe modern data landscape demands a new approach: specialized tools working in harmony rather than monolithic solutions trying to do everything. But how do you actually build a stack that delivers on this promise?This talk explores three fundamental principles transforming how we build data platforms: choosing the right tool for each specific job, developing locally before deploying globally, and maintaining unified observability across your entire ecosystem.Through the lens of PostgreSQL's transactional reliability, DuckDB's analytical speed, and Dagster's orchestration intelligence, you'll see how these principles create platforms that scale from your laptop to production while giving teams the visibility and confidence they need to ship reliably.\n\npresented by Yuhan Luo, Head of Product @ Dagster Labs\n\n#SFTechWeek\n\n\n\nThis event is a part of #SFTechWeek—a week of events hosted by VCs and startups to bring together the tech ecosystem.

    "description": "Join XR's leading innovators to dive into how AI-driven hardware is crafting a digital reality surpassing the natural world.\n\nA decentralized and organic event that brings together top global XR founders and builders, tech investors, XR ecosystem veterans, and hardware enthusiasts. Communicate in person, share your insights and lessons on what it truly takes to “build” - the highs, the lows, and everything in between. \n\n👀 EuReality Event: We help founders create momentum with bold visions and craftsmanship mindset in the digital reality era.  — “If a tree falls in the forest and no one hears it, did it happen?”\n\n------\n\nBehind the Name:\n\nEuReality is the next frontier—a collective, interdependent digital reality where intelligent machines and synthetic data cooperate seamlessly to create a reality beyond the natural.\n\nThe past few decades, defined by the fifth Kondratiev wave, marked the small-information era of electronics and the Internet. The coming sixth wave will ignite the big-information era, powered by autonomous intelligent machines—hardware in the physical world—that will transform how humanity lives, works, and imagines the future.\n\nLooking further ahead, guided by First Principles that technology evolves in a ‘Left-Right-Left’ cycle, the next wave will bring the intelligent revolution. Robots, drones, aircrafts, and autonomous vehicles will generate vast streams of synthetic data, pushing a profound upgrade of the digital realm and crafting a digital reality that surpasses the natural world.\n\nNow is the critical window to shape this future. We stand at a paradigm crossroads: from “human value comes from our labor” to “human value comes from who we are.” I believe in this shift, and I have named it EuReality.\n\nInspired by eusociality—the highest form of social organization in biology, where individuals thrive through cooperation, specialization, and shared purpose—eureality reimagines this principle for technology. It embodies distributed intelligence: machines and systems acting collectively, like a superorganism.\n\nIn the digital realm, eureality is not just an upgrade; it is an ecosystem of intelligent machines, smart hardware, and synthetic data working together to create a reality more connected, adaptive, and transformative than ever before. \n\n👀 This event is a part of #SFTechWeek—a week of events hosted by VCs and startups to bring together the tech ecosystem.

In intimate small groups of 4, you'll practice real tools for conscious leadership while connecting with peers facing similar challenges.\n\nBased on principles from organizational transformation and cutting-edge leadership development, you'll discover how to upgrade your internal \"operating system\" – the mindsets, practices, and awareness that enable leaders to drive breakthrough growth without burning out.\n\nNotable Speakers/Facilitators:\n\nTiffany Joy Basse - Managing Director at OM Impact Fund, Author of \"The Conscious Leader: Empowering the Next Generation of CEOs\" and \"The Growth Code.\" Serial entrepreneur and impact investor who has evaluated over 2,000 startups and helped companies raise hundreds of millions in venture funding. Keynote speaker at Yale Impact Investing, Stanford AI for Good, SF GenAI, and Human Tech Week.\n\nChris Roberts - Founder of Profound Shift, Partner & Chief Risk Officer at Thing Zero. Executive coach to high-performing Silicon Valley leaders, helping organizations thrive in risk, growth, and complexity. Former Managing Director at Edgile with deep expertise in organizational transformation and leadership development through crisis.\n\nStorm Cattoche - Founder of StormLife Solutions, Oracle Advisor and Consciousness Educator. With over three decades of global leadership experience spanning real estate, insurance, and consciousness education, Storm specializes in helping executives lead with clarity, purpose, and higher consciousness through alignment and intentional action.\n\nFormat & Content:\n\n15-minute panel discussion: Best practices from three experienced conscious leaders\n2 rounds of intimate 20-minute working sessions (groups of 4)\nLive practice of consciousness techniques used by successful tech leaders\nPeer-to-peer learning and network building\nStory circles and pattern finding exercises\nTake-home practices you'll implement immediately\n\nWhat Makes It Special:\nThis isn't just another panel about conscious leadership – it's a direct experience of it. After hearing best practices from our expert facilitators, you'll immediately put these concepts into practice through structured small-group exercises.\n\nOur facilitators bring complementary expertise: Tiffany's venture and growth experience meets Chris's organizational transformation mastery and Storm's consciousness-based leadership approach. \n\nTogether, they create a holistic experience addressing both the tactical and transcendent aspects of leadership.\n\nThe combination of panel insights followed by experiential practice ensures you don't just learn about conscious leadership intellectually – you embody it through real interaction and practice. Small group work ensures deep, meaningful connections rather than surface-level networking.\n\nPerfect for: Founders, CTOs, VPs, and senior leaders ready to evolve beyond traditional management approaches and lead from a place of greater awareness, especially those navigating rapid scaling, team transformation, or the integration of AI into their organizations.\n\nYou'll leave with: Practical insights from seasoned leaders, a personal practice plan, accountability partners, and the lived experience of what conscious leadership actually feels like in action.\n\nThis event is a part of #SFTechWeek—a week of events hosted by VCs and startups to bring together the tech ecosystem.

During Techweek, every night Sunday through Saturday, I’m hosting a private poker/founders lounge inside the sleek offices of AngelList. Yes, you read that right: poker in the house that built modern startup investing.\n\n​I’ve teamed up with AngelList because there’s no better backdrop for big bets and bold bluffs. Think polished floors, startup lore, and the kind of place where “all-in” could mean your next round.\n\n​*****Drinks & Snacks Included!*****\n\n-----------\nCHOOSE YOUR FLAVOR:\n​At the table (or around it), you’ve got three ways to play:\n-----------\n​- 10c/20c No-Limit Hold ’Em — for the poker-curious\n- ​1/1 No-Limit Hold ’Em — light sparring, the warm-up ring.\n​- 5/5 No-Limit Hold ’Em — where the sharks circle and the pots get real.\n​- Drinks & Socializing — because sometimes the best move is sitting back with a whiskey and letting others show their tells.\n\n-----------\n​Who Belongs Here\n-----------\n​Founders who’ve raised $1M+ (you’ve proven you can ante up).\n​Investors & LPs who know that real deal flow happens after-hours.\n​Anyone who understands that poker is about character, risk, and nerve.\n​Why Show Up?\n\n​Because you’ll learn more about someone’s true game in two hours here than in twenty pitch meetings. Because this is AngelList + the Spice King — two brands that don’t exactly do “casual.” And because in this room, even a losing hand might win you your next deal.\n\n-----------\n​The Ground Rules\n-----------\n​No sneaking in: This is badged-in, ID-checked, guest-list-only. If you’re not approved, you’re not crossing that lobby.\n\n​Respect the seat: Take a spot, then ghost? You’ll be exiled from the Spice King’s future events. No second chances.\n\n​Special guests: Each night will feature surprise players — the kind who don’t just play the game, they change it.\n\n​Seats are scarce. The vibe is sharp.

    "title": "Ugly Talk: Women Tech Founders #SFTechWeek",
    "description": "In the heart of the world’s most ambitious startup scene, women founders are still being told the playing field is “better than ever.” The numbers disagree. In 2025, women-led startups in the U.S. pulled just over 2% of all VC dollars — in SF, that means the game is still mostly played without you on the roster.\n\nEven for seasoned founders, the warm-intro culture of Sand Hill Road keeps capital locked behind closed doors. Investors still pitch men on “market domination” and women on “risk mitigation.” AI, deep tech, and SaaS get the headlines, but the bar for women to raise in those sectors sits higher — and often comes with double the scrutiny.\n\nIn a city obsessed with the “next big thing,” women founders are forced to prove their staying power before they’ve even gotten a fair shot at scale.\n\n🎯 Why You Should Attend\nBecause the SF hustle isn’t slowing down, and neither are the expectations. You’ll hear from founders who’ve raised in the most cut-throat funding climate in years, navigated the old biases wearing new disguises, and built companies that punch through without losing themselves in the process.\n\nIf you’re building in tech — whether it’s AI, enterprise, consumer apps, or the next category-breaker — this is where you’ll learn how to navigate the maze, spot the landmines, and find your people.\n\n🙋 Who You’ll Meet\nWomen tech founders from pre-seed to Series B .\nInvestors and ecosystem builders with deep roots in SF’s venture scene.\nOperators, mentors, and allies who’ve seen the game from the inside and want it to change.\n\n🎤 Who’s on the Panel\n\nMehak Aggarwal - Co-Founder of Sybill\n\nFounder and head of AI at a silicon valley startup Sybill that’s raised $15M+. She’s also an engineering nerd. Sybill is AI sales assistant who can answer deal questions, create sales assets, and automate grunt work like meeting prep, email follow-ups, and CRM updates.\n\n\nHaruka Takamori - Co-Founder & CEO of Syval\n\nHaruka Takamori is the founder of Syval, a money journaling app that helps people quit impulse buying and understand the emotions behind their spending. She grew up in Taiwan in a single-parent household and later worked at ByteDance, in investment banking, and in venture capital. After overcoming her own shopping addiction, Haruka moved to San Francisco to build Syval. Inspired by personal experiences with financial instability, she is committed to making financial wellness accessible to all. Beyond startups, Haruka is trilingual and an active advocate for founder wellness and mindfulness practices.\n\n\nAlyona Mysko - Founder & CEO of Fuelfinance\n\nAlyona Mysko is the CEO and Co-Founder of Fuelfinance, an AI-powered financial planning and analysis platform built for SMBs. Before starting Fuel, she spent 10+ years as a CFO helping founders handle messy spreadsheets and build forecasts. Now she’s scaling that superpower with AI, giving founders real-time visibility into their numbers and faster decisions without hiring a full finance team. She’s a Masters of Scale podcast guest, a HubSpot INBOUND speaker, and finalist in the $1M Pitch Competition by Hubspot. With Fuel, customers manage over $400M+ in P&L, including companies like Hampton, ColdIQ, Oceans, and others. Fuel’s mission is to save SMBs from financial mistakes, and unlock trillions of dollars in global GDP.\n\n\nModerator:\n\nJenny Chen - CEO of WalktheChat\n\nJenny runs a performance marketing and data analytics agency that used AI to drive strategic insights for global luxury brands such as Louis Vuitton, Armani, and Chaumet. A recognized leader in social media and e-commerce within the fashion space, she spent 12 years in Beijing before moving to the U.S., where she lived in five cities across both coasts over 6 months before finally settling in San Francisco.\n\n\n💬 What We’ll Talk About\nWhy SF’s “open network” is still a closed loop without the right intros — and how to break in.\nThe new face of bias in venture: same double standard, now dressed in AI hype and “metrics discipline.”\nSurviving the hyper-competitive pitch circuit without burning out.\nWhat’s working right now for women raising in SaaS, AI, and other high-growth sectors.\nBuilding companies that scale on your terms, not just your investors’.\n\n🤝 Co-hosted With\n\nGlobal Entrepreneurs Hub - Silicon Valley’s $1M+ ARR+ Founder Community.\n\nGREY Journal – Media partner spotlighting modern entrepreneurs (featured on Apple News + Google News).\n\n🤝 Venue Partner\n\nPersona - An online identity verification platform that helps businesses, from any size and industry to collect, verify, and manage user identities throughout a customer lifecycle. Available in over 200 countries.

    "description": "Foreign-born founders are behind many of the most promising U.S. startups, yet immigration hurdles, compliance, and funding risks can stall even the best ideas. For international entrepreneurs and the VCs who back them, navigating visas, investment structures, and regulatory rules is critical to building scalable companies.\n\nThis session brings together cross-border investors, immigrant founders, and immigration attorneys to share insights and real-world stories. The discussion will cover founder-friendly visa pathways, best practices for equity and governance, and strategies for VCs to responsibly support foreign talent—highlighting both challenges and opportunities at the intersection of immigration strategy and venture growth.\n\nFrom H-1Bs and O-1s to E-2s and EB-1s, the panel will demystify how immigration law, startup formation, and venture funding intersect—so founders and investors can move forward with confidence.\n\nPanelists: \n- Eugene Malobrodsky (Managing Partner, One Way Ventures)\n- Ihar Mahaniok (Managing Partner, Geek Ventures)\n- Michael Serotte (Founder, Serotte Law, Immigration Counsel for Stanford's StartX and Graduate School of Business)\n- Mariana Antcheva (General Counsel and Chief Administrative Officer, Pilot) \n- Bolun Li (Founder, Zogo)\n- Vinit Bhansali (General Partner, Takshil Venture Partners) \n- Moderator: Christina Chen (Head of Business Development, GoElite)\n\nThis event is a part of #SFTechWeek—a week of events hosted by VCs and startups to bring together the tech ecosystem.

    "title": "Ugly Talk: Women Tech Founders #SFTechWeek",
    "description": "In the heart of the world’s most ambitious startup scene, women founders are still being told the playing field is “better than ever.” The numbers disagree. In 2025, women-led startups in the U.S. pulled just over 2% of all VC dollars — in SF, that means the game is still mostly played without you on the roster.\n\nEven for seasoned founders, the warm-intro culture of Sand Hill Road keeps capital locked behind closed doors. Investors still pitch men on “market domination” and women on “risk mitigation.” AI, deep tech, and SaaS get the headlines, but the bar for women to raise in those sectors sits higher — and often comes with double the scrutiny.\n\nIn a city obsessed with the “next big thing,” women founders are forced to prove their staying power before they’ve even gotten a fair shot at scale.\n\n🎯 Why You Should Attend\nBecause the SF hustle isn’t slowing down, and neither are the expectations. You’ll hear from founders who’ve raised in the most cut-throat funding climate in years, navigated the old biases wearing new disguises, and built companies that punch through without losing themselves in the process.\n\nIf you’re building in tech — whether it’s AI, enterprise, consumer apps, or the next category-breaker — this is where you’ll learn how to navigate the maze, spot the landmines, and find your people.\n\n🙋 Who You’ll Meet\nWomen tech founders from pre-seed to Series B .\nInvestors and ecosystem builders with deep roots in SF’s venture scene.\nOperators, mentors, and allies who’ve seen the game from the inside and want it to change.\n\n🎤 Who’s on the Panel\n\nMehak Aggarwal - Co-Founder of Sybill\n\nFounder and head of AI at a silicon valley startup Sybill that’s raised $15M+. She’s also an engineering nerd. Sybill is AI sales assistant who can answer deal questions, create sales assets, and automate grunt work like meeting prep, email follow-ups, and CRM updates.\n\n\nHaruka Takamori - Co-Founder & CEO of Syval\n\nHaruka Takamori is the founder of Syval, a money journaling app that helps people quit impulse buying and understand the emotions behind their spending. She grew up in Taiwan in a single-parent household and later worked at ByteDance, in investment banking, and in venture capital. After overcoming her own shopping addiction, Haruka moved to San Francisco to build Syval. Inspired by personal experiences with financial instability, she is committed to making financial wellness accessible to all. Beyond startups, Haruka is trilingual and an active advocate for founder wellness and mindfulness practices.\n\n\nAlyona Mysko - Founder & CEO of Fuelfinance\n\nAlyona Mysko is the CEO and Co-Founder of Fuelfinance, an AI-powered financial planning and analysis platform built for SMBs. Before starting Fuel, she spent 10+ years as a CFO helping founders handle messy spreadsheets and build forecasts. Now she’s scaling that superpower with AI, giving founders real-time visibility into their numbers and faster decisions without hiring a full finance team. She’s a Masters of Scale podcast guest, a HubSpot INBOUND speaker, and finalist in the $1M Pitch Competition by Hubspot. With Fuel, customers manage over $400M+ in P&L, including companies like Hampton, ColdIQ, Oceans, and others. Fuel’s mission is to save SMBs from financial mistakes, and unlock trillions of dollars in global GDP.\n\n\nModerator:\n\nJenny Chen - CEO of WalktheChat\n\nJenny runs a performance marketing and data analytics agency that used AI to drive strategic insights for global luxury brands such as Louis Vuitton, Armani, and Chaumet. A recognized leader in social media and e-commerce within the fashion space, she spent 12 years in Beijing before moving to the U.S., where she lived in five cities across both coasts over 6 months before finally settling in San Francisco.\n\n\n💬 What We’ll Talk About\nWhy SF’s “open network” is still a closed loop without the right intros — and how to break in.\nThe new face of bias in venture: same double standard, now dressed in AI hype and “metrics discipline.”\nSurviving the hyper-competitive pitch circuit without burning out.\nWhat’s working right now for women raising in SaaS, AI, and other high-growth sectors.\nBuilding companies that scale on your terms, not just your investors’.\n\n🤝 Co-hosted With\n\nGlobal Entrepreneurs Hub - Silicon Valley’s $1M+ ARR+ Founder Community.\n\nGREY Journal – Media partner spotlighting modern entrepreneurs (featured on Apple News + Google News).\n\n🤝 Venue Partner\n\nPersona - An online identity verification platform that helps businesses, from any size and industry to collect, verify, and manage user identities throughout a customer lifecycle. Available in over 200 countries. Starting at $0.\n\n⭐ About Ugly Talk:\nStarted in 2019, Ugly Talk has been transforming business setbacks into breakthrough “aha!” moments by hosting unfiltered, no-nonsense events where battle-tested entrepreneurs share their raw lessons and insights.\n\nWith a growing presence in cities like New York, Chicago, San Francisco, and Miami, we’ve built a vibrant community of thousands of founders and industry leaders making a profound impact on the entrepreneurial landscape.\n\nOfficial Website: UglyTalk.com\n\nThis event is a part of #SFTechWeek—a week of events hosted by VCs and startups to bring together the tech ecosystem.

He will be presenting about Cisco's Gen AI journey for drastically improving employee experience.\n\nOverview:\n\nGenerative AI is everywhere; turning pilots into production at enterprise scale is the hard part. This talk goes behind the scenes of CIRCUIT—Cisco’s #1-used AI tool and enterprise agent ecosystem—now powering 100K+ employee interactions every business day and serving 4,000+ internal teams via LLM-as-a-Service and RAG-as-a-Service (powered by Pinecone Vector Database).\n\nWe’ll unpack the search & cloud engineering that makes it work: an LLM router and agent orchestration layer (built with LangGraph) that routes tasks to the right expert agent/LLM; an AI Agentic Mesh with an Enterprise Agent/MCP Registry for discovery, governance, and reuse; and a security-first model using OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange (RFC 8693) so agents invoke one another with with secure identity propagation and a complete, auditable chain of custody.\n\nYou’ll see how Deep Research Agents blend web + internal knowledge for actionable research reports; Personal & Cisco Data RAG enable safe BYO data (e.g., OneDrive); Data Analysis Agents accelerate insights; and a PPT Agent turns conversations into decks for faster storytelling. With Cisco AI Pods and Leading LLMs, employees can choose the best model for the job. We’ll close with outcomes from assistants in Sales (GSX), Cisco events (Cisco Live), support, and engineering—covering proposal generation, RFP compliance, and bug triage—and share the patterns to replicate this in your org.\n\nTakeaways\n\t•\tReference architecture for agentic, multi-LLM platforms at enterprise scale\n\t•\tPatterns for reliable, stateful agents using LangGraph\n\t•\tSecurity model with OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange, agent identities, and audit trails\n\t•\tOperating model: registry, governance, and cross-agent reuse\n\t•\tRAG at Scale with Pinecone Vector Database\n\t•\tPractical playbook to move from POC to production with measurable productivity gains",

    "description": "As Agentic AI moves from concept to implementation, it is not just the technology that needs to scale — it is also the people. Today, organizations across every industry are being forced to rethink what talent means, how roles evolve, and what it truly takes to be “AI-ready.” \n\nBut here’s the problem: while AI product vendors continue to launch capabilities at breakneck speed, their System Integrator (SI) partners and enterprise customers are falling behind on enablement. Most employees don’t just need to learn new tools — they need to reinvent how they work. And yet, training systems are stuck in legacy mode: outdated content, low certification rates (often below 30%), and one-size-fits-all approaches that don't stick. \n\nThis session addresses a critical — and often overlooked — gap in the AI transformation journey: scaling workforce readiness with the same speed and intentionality as the technology itself. \n\nThis event is a part of #SFTechWeek—a week of events hosted by VCs and startups to bring together the tech ecosystem.

    "description": "Wednesday, Oct 85:00pm – 8:00pmPTGMTHosted by^⎵^+3In the era of rapid technological progress, we often underestimate how deeply the built world shapes our lives. While Silicon Valley races toward AGI, construction, one of the oldest yet most critical industries, still struggles with inefficiencies that touch us every day. Even something as simple as the price of the milk you buy at your local grocery store is influenced by the hidden costs of construction inefficiency.\n\nAt this SF Tech Week event, hosted by Surfaice, we’ll dive into the challenges construction faces today and how AI is reshaping its future.\n\nThe panel will feature a unique conversation structured across three “horizons” of AI in construction:\n\n– Distant Horizon: Nelson Koen, lecturer at Stanford and expert in real estate and construction, will share his long-term vision for how far AI can go and what excites him most about the future.\n– Mid Horizon (3–5 years): KP Reddy, Managing Partner at Shadow VC and a leading voice in AEC disruption, will explore where he sees the industry heading from an investment and innovation perspective.\n– Near Horizon (Now): Alexey Dubov, engineer and entrepreneur turned VC, will discuss what’s actually happening today as startups adopt AI and push for pilots across the industry.\n– Today’s Impact: A special guest speaker with a deep AI background (Google DeepMind/Stanford PhD) will reveal what they’re launching now — and how it’s already changing the daily life of construction professionals.\n– Alim Uderbekov, CEO & Founder Surfaice.pro, aerospace engineer and serial entrepreneur will moderate this session.\n\nBy taking this step-by-step approach across horizons, we’ll explore how AI can unlock massive productivity gains and transform one of the world’s most important industries.\n\nJoin us to explore how AI can unlock massive productivity gains in construction and transform one of the world’s most important industries.\n\nThis event is proudly supported by Surfaice, Silk Road Innovation Hub and our friends and partners.\n\nThis event is a part of #SFTechWeek—a week of events hosted by VCs and startups to bring together the tech ecosystem.

    "description": "​-----------\n🃏 The Spice King’s Poker Nights at Techweek\n-----------\n​Founders, investors, LPs — the Spice King summons you. During Techweek, every night Sunday through Saturday, I’m hosting a private poker/founders lounge inside the sleek offices of AngelList. Yes, you read that right: poker in the house that built modern startup investing.\n\n​I’ve teamed up with AngelList because there’s no better backdrop for big bets and bold bluffs. Think polished floors, startup lore, and the kind of place where “all-in” could mean your next round.\n\n​*****Drinks & Snacks Included!*****\n\n-----------\nCHOOSE YOUR FLAVOR:\n​At the table (or around it), you’ve got three ways to play:\n-----------\n​- 10c/20c No-Limit Hold ’Em — for the poker-curious\n- ​1/1 No-Limit Hold ’Em — light sparring, the warm-up ring.\n​- 5/5 No-Limit Hold ’Em — where the sharks circle and the pots get real.\n​- Drinks & Socializing — because sometimes the best move is sitting back with a whiskey and letting others show their tells.\n\n-----------\n​Who Belongs Here\n-----------\n​Founders who’ve raised $1M+ (you’ve proven you can ante up).\n​Investors & LPs who know that real deal flow happens after-hours.\n​Anyone who understands that poker is about character, risk, and nerve.\n​Why Show Up?\n\n​Because you’ll learn more about someone’s true game in two hours here than in twenty pitch meetings. Because this is AngelList + the Spice King — two brands that don’t exactly do “casual.” And because in this room, even a losing hand might win you your next deal.\n\n-----------\n​The Ground Rules\n-----------\n​No sneaking in: This is badged-in, ID-checked, guest-list-only. If you’re not approved, you’re not crossing that lobby.\n\n​Respect the seat: Take a spot, then ghost? You’ll be exiled from the Spice King’s future events. No second chances.\n\n​Special guests: Each night will feature surprise players — the kind who don’t just play the game, they change it.\n\n​Seats are scarce. The vibe is sharp. The room is swank.\n\n​— Spice King of Zanzibar\nhttps://lu.ma/spicekingofzanzibar\n\n———\nRSVP TO OTHER POKER NIGHTS DURING TECHWEEK!\n———\n———\nRSVP TO OTHER POKER NIGHTS DURING TECHWEEK!\n———\nMon Oct 6 - https://partiful.com/e/2s9AgbnP19mlXLQ4zi3C\nTue Oct 7 - https://partiful.com/e/60mj0wQK2dFvfD32WS7A\nThu Oct 9 - https://partiful.com/e/4ZomYSAK9jE18kGcZez6\nFri Oct 10 - https://partiful.com/e/GDPbUkJbQoOg06yzEaKR\nSat Oct 11 - https://partiful.com/e/qXfdoYoNqdhuEGvouM64\n\n-----------\nThis event is a part of #SFTechWeek—a week of events hosted by VCs and startups to bring together the tech ecosystem.

    "description": "Wednesday, Oct 87:00pmPTGMTHosted by˘▿˘*◟*^◡^+5This salon invites discussion on LifeLanguage companies and their use of AI as a force for good in healthcare.\n\nLifeLanguage companies specialize in building new AI models to understand the languages of life—proteins, RNA, and DNA. These companies differ from traditional biotech in that they investigate these languages not with wet-lab approaches but with GPUs. AlphaFold is a leading example in this nascent space and won the Nobel Prize last year. Since then, many startups have modeled their teams after the AlphaFold team, generating sister models that rearrange protein space to form combinations that would have taken evolution hundreds of millions of years to create. These new rearrangements have special properties for curing human disease, strengthening agriculture, and improving manufacturing.\n\nAt Ecotone, our mission is to pioneer the next frontier: a model we call Hawaiian Diamond, capable of reading the human genome-as-a-first-language. The challenge is that AlphaFold was possible because of 3D protein data (PDB), where each protein structure serves as a spatial scaffold. For DNA, which is an encoded information space, no such training data exists. Our breakthrough is a novel method to create this data by shifting from spatial to functional understanding. We interlace, arrange, and layer genomic outputs to build a functional scaffold—the \"Point Cloud Feature\"—that assigns meaning to sections of DNA. Hawaiian Diamond, trained on these scaffolds, will directly pinpoint the root causes of disease, generating the GPS coordinates needed by DNA-guided medications (e.g., CRISPRs) to cure all 10,000 genetic diseases. This will improve the lives of approximately 800 million people and begin the process of fully annotating the mysterious, unresolved sections of our DNA.\n\nCome and discuss over champagne and [maybe] oysters at a secret cozy space.  Thanks to our sponsors Columbia University Venture Community (CVC SF) and #SFTechWeek.\n\nFormat: Fireside chat followed by conversation and good vibes.  Location will be made available the day before the event.\n\nThis event is a part of #SFTechWeek—a week of events hosted by VCs and startups to bring together the tech ecosystem.

That’s where Idea Clerk comes in.

Instead of spending thousands and waiting weeks, startups can get strong, same-day “patent pending” protection for under $100, with filings that both attorneys and investors can take seriously.\n\nAt this hands-on Tech Week session, founders will learn why IP matters earlier than you think, see a live demo of Idea Clerk in action, and file their own provisional patent applications on the spot — FREE.

Join Globiant and TheAgentic for a discussion on how fast growing vertical AI startups can rapidly scale into LatAm (Brazil 1st) and other emerging markets through a “cloning” model that pairs SF Bay Area Leading IP with in region capital, leadership, governance, and deep local market expertise. \n\nFounders learn how they can capture new int'l markets without dilution and mission distraction supported by local leadership and funding. The goal being creating more strategic value, faster from their start-up - executing in parallel - that they can recapture, consolidate accretively!\n\nAnd investors interested in capitalizing AI internationally gain de-risked opportunities for leveraged growth and a liquidity plan. \n\nBoth Founders and Investors benefiting from vertical B2B Agentic AI platforms that specifically target capitalizing on accelerated adoption abroad in under served emerging markets. \n\nWe'll also discuss the real world case of eWork - where $3M initial investment in cloning resulted in a $100M IPO of a thriving Technology company. Globiant brings that hyper-scaling internationalization cloning model to market with the AI area. We'll also touch upon how this model is an improvement on the Rocket Internet ($4B+ raised) approach.\n\nGo Global Smarter! — Best ROI: Controlled Expansion, Lower Risk, Fully Funded, Faster Growth, Local Talent and Governance with Planned Liquidity. \n\nSpeakers: \nHans Bukow - 30+ yr serial VC backed int'l tech entrepreneur with deep founder to IPO experience - Globiant CEO\n\nAkash Saraf - 20+ yr serial entrepreneur with several successful large ventures - TheAgentic CEO\n\nOther Internationally recognized successful AI entrepreneurs and investors attending\n\nStay tuned here as we add more details on the event.\n\nThis event is a part of #SFTechWeek—a week of events hosted by VCs and startups to bring together the tech ecosystem.

    "description": "Thursday, Oct 92:00pm – 5:00pmPTGMTHosted by❛o❛+30/68 spots leftYou’re invited to an exclusive event hosted by Autonomic Health, the company redefining preventive care by unlocking the body’s real-time operating system, the autonomic nervous system (ANS). It is building the first AI engine for the nervous system, exclusively trained on the world's largest FDA-grade ANS dataset.\n\nWHY IT MATTERS:  \n\nThe ANS regulates every major organ and function in the body. Research shows that 70–99% of people have some form of autonomic dysfunction, which is the hidden indicator/driver of most of our illnesses—from cardiovascular disease to chronic anxiety/depression—and is the only proven protocol for mystery illnesses (women’s health, autoimmune disorders, Long COVID, POTS, among others) where traditional diagnostics using blood panels and scans fail. Yet ANS testing remains the most under-utilized protocol in medicine. Until now, full ANS testing was hidden inside niche specialty clinics. Today, Autonomic Health invites you to a private event to experience the only FDA-approved, non-invasive, full diagnostic of the autonomic nervous system and learn how unlocking the body's operating system will transform healthcare.\n\nWHAT TO EXPECT:  \n\n(1) A fireside chat on why the nervous system is the foundation of preventive care and how AI + wearables are finally unlocking this foundational protocol for the mainstream  \n\n- Dr. Joe Colombo (PhD, DNM, DHS): Considered the “father of the autonomic nervous system,” Dr Colombo invented the only FDA-approved ANS diagnostic, co-authored the defining medical ANS textbook, and has published 200+ papers  \n\n- Dr. Swamy (MD, FACR): A leading American rheumatologist and founder of Attune Health (Beverly Hills, CA); Clinical Chief at Cedars Sinai; Education Chair at the  American College of Rheumatology.\n\n(2) Live demo of a full ANS test to show how a seamless, non-invasive 15-minute diagnostic can reveal hidden dysfunction long before symptoms or labs appear \n\n(3) Optional complimentary test for a limited number of attendees, with a personalized ANS assessment and recommendations to balance their nervous system, which prevents disease, ensures daily vitality and extends health span.  \n\nPROGRAM:\n\n2:00-2:30 - Check-in\n\n​2:30-3:30 - Fireside chat + Q&A\n\n​3:30-3:45 - Live demo of the test\n\n​3:45-5:00 - Complimentary tests for selected guests\n\nAttendance is by invitation only:  \nJoin us to experience firsthand the future of preventive healthcare—and why investors see the $100B+ preventive care market as one of the most exciting frontiers of the decade.\n\nThis event is a part of #SFTechWeek—a week of events hosted by VCs and startups to bring together the tech ecosystem.

    "description": "Thursday, Oct 166:00pmPTGMTHosted by*◟*+310 total spotshttps://www.heizen.work/Join Heizen during LA Tech Week for an exclusive, closed-door roundtable at one of LA’s premier cigar salons. This evening is for a curated group of leaders tasked with driving operational excellence in an age of disruption.\n\nIn today's complex enterprises, a significant disconnect often exists between corporate leadership focused on strategy and the on-ground teams handling real-time execution. This gap leads to misaligned software, failed AI adoption, and missed opportunities. As one strategist noted, the most critical missing asset is an \"integrated view from the factory floor to the foxhole\". Legacy systems and siloed data are no longer a stable foundation—they are the quickest path to being outmaneuvered.\n\nThis roundtable is a candid, off-the-record discussion on closing these operational gaps. We will explore how bespoke AI transformation—powered by embedded engineering talent—can bridge the divide between strategy and execution, modernizing legacy systems and unlocking efficiency gains. We believe, as Napoleon demonstrated, that the greatest results come when leaders are \"in the trenches\" with their teams, solving real problems on the ground.\n\nOur discussion will center on tangible strategies for:\n• Bridging the gap between executive vision and front-line execution.\n• Leveraging custom AI for legacy modernization, internal tooling, and enhanced operational visibility.\n• Deploying agile engineering teams that embed with your staff to drive adoption and deliver practical, iterative solutions, mirroring the successful Forward Deployed Engineer (FDE) model.\n\nWho Should Attend?\n\nThis is an invite-only event for VPs, Directors, and C-Suite executives from enterprise and mid-market companies ($100M+ revenue). If you lead teams in complex, operations-heavy environments and are responsible for driving AI strategy and transformation, we want you in the room.\n\nWhat to Expect\n• Candid Conversation: A private discussion with a small group of industry leaders who understand that your status quo is the losing state.\n\n• Premium Experience: A selection of world-class cigars and top-shelf spirits.\n\n• High-Caliber Networking: Connect with peers who, like you, are shaping the narrative arc of their companies from challenge to greatness.\n\nThis is your opportunity to forge the path to operational leadership. Spaces are extremely limited to ensure a valuable and intimate conversation.\n\nThis event is a part of #LATechWeek—a week of events hosted by VCs and startups to bring together the tech ecosystem.

    "title": "Founder Therapy: Smarter Numbers, Less Nonsense - #SFTechWeek",
    "description": "🚀 Spreadsheets are fine… if you like drowning. But investors (and your sanity) demand better. \n\n​As part of SF Tech Week, Startup Intros, BridgeBank & ScaleSpark are hosting a panel that gets real about startup finances. We’ll talk about automating the grunt work, the alternative financing options that actually exist beyond the tired “bootstrap vs. VC” narrative, and why investors are done with vanity metrics and demand real-time numbers they can trust.\n\n​If you’re serious about building a company that can survive the lean years and pass investor scrutiny, skip the fluff and join us.\n\nPanelists:\n\nTejal Shah, VP Investment Banking, US Capital Global\nTejal Shah brings to US Capital Global a strong background in financial services and asset management, along with expertise in capital raising and fostering high-value relationships with VIP clients. Ms. Shah’s career commenced at Merrill Lynch and Bank of America as a Wealth Manager and then left to co-founded Peninsula Wealth, a registered independent wealth management firm where she successfully oversaw $400 million in asset.\n\nWith a decade of serial entrepreneurial experience in early-stage startups, Ms. Shah has successfully conceptualized, funded, launched, and scaled multiple businesses. Her profound grasp of the startup landscape encompasses business development, fundraising, and operations.\n\nBefore her tenure at US Capital Global, Ms. Shah served as a limited partner at Refactor Capital and Halogen Ventures, both instrumental in evaluating startups for potential VC investments and offering strategic advice. Notably, she steered 555 Comic Co in San Francisco as COO, securing $6.1 million in venture capital. Her first startup was KidAdmit, pioneering venture capital funding in the early education market backed by some of the most well known venture capital firms including SV Angel, K9 Ventures, Urban Innovation Fund to name a few.\n\nMs. Shah’s academic background includes a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Rochester, NY and started her career in technical roles in Product Design for Ford Motor Company, medical devices, and air pollution control systems.\n\nSerge Amouzou, CEO & Founder, Verza\nI'm all-in on Verza, an AI-powered financial co-pilot for the creator economy. We're solving the critical 'deal side' problem for creators—from smart contract management and accelerated payments to effortless tax prep and banking. In just a month and a half, Verza has shipped its MVP and gained early adoption from paying users, including top creators globally. We're building a revenue-driven, capital-efficient business designed for rapid scale.\n\nMy journey to Verza began with Datatrixs, an AI insights platform, where valuable market learnings led to this focused pivot. Before that, I founded the FinTech company Delect, earning BBJ CEO of the Year in 2017 for my innovative work in streamlining restaurant operations and significantly increasing waitstaff earnings.\n\n​🔑 What you’ll take away:\n\n​Funding options that go beyond bootstrapping and can help you get to the next raise without dilution.\n\n​How to automate your financial ops so you can get the real-time numbers you need and investors want.\n\n​Strategies to move off spreadsheets and onto automation without losing your sanity (or your company).\n\n​👥 Who should attend:\n\n​Founders gearing up for the next raise.\n\n​Operators and finance leads who want smarter systems, not more chaos.\n\n​Startup teams’ sick of busywork and bad metrics.\n\n​Finance and Ops teams who want to stop scrubbing data and start using real-time data strategically. \n\n​ScaleSpark Founded by operators who've lived the startup chaos. They install your SparkStack so you can get back to building, hiring, and leading because you weren't funded to build your back office.\n\n​BridgeBank is Silicon Valley's original startup bank. From pre-revenue to IPO, they've backed bold entrepreneurs with sophisticated financing and an understanding that growth takes time.\n\n​Startup Intros is a media and intelligence platform that enables founders to connect with the right investors through warm introductions, signal-driven events, and a trusted email newsletter. Incubated at Context VC, we are on a mission to democratize funding and make the ecosystem more efficient.\n\n​Context Ventures is an early-stage venture firm that backs leaders who seek context. We invest early, move fast, and stay hands-on to help transformative companies take root and grow, with 90% of our capital going to military veteran founders.\n\nThis event is a part of #SFTechWeek—a week of events hosted by VCs and startups to bring together the tech ecosystem.

    "description": "​-----------\n🃏 The Spice King’s Poker Nights at Techweek\n-----------\n​Founders, investors, LPs — the Spice King summons you. During Techweek, every night Sunday through Saturday, I’m hosting a private poker/founders lounge inside the sleek offices of AngelList. Yes, you read that right: poker in the house that built modern startup investing.\n\n​I’ve teamed up with AngelList because there’s no better backdrop for big bets and bold bluffs. Think polished floors, startup lore, and the kind of place where “all-in” could mean your next round.\n\n​*****Drinks & Snacks Included!*****\n\n-----------\nCHOOSE YOUR FLAVOR:\n​At the table (or around it), you’ve got three ways to play:\n-----------\n​- 10c/20c No-Limit Hold ’Em — for the poker-curious\n- ​1/1 No-Limit Hold ’Em — light sparring, the warm-up ring.\n​- 5/5 No-Limit Hold ’Em — where the sharks circle and the pots get real.\n​- Drinks & Socializing — because sometimes the best move is sitting back with a whiskey and letting others show their tells.\n\n-----------\n​Who Belongs Here\n-----------\n​Founders who’ve raised $1M+ (you’ve proven you can ante up).\n​Investors & LPs who know that real deal flow happens after-hours.\n​Anyone who understands that poker is about character, risk, and nerve.\n​Why Show Up?\n\n​Because you’ll learn more about someone’s true game in two hours here than in twenty pitch meetings. Because this is AngelList + the Spice King — two brands that don’t exactly do “casual.” And because in this room, even a losing hand might win you your next deal.\n\n-----------\n​The Ground Rules\n-----------\n​No sneaking in: This is badged-in, ID-checked, guest-list-only. If you’re not approved, you’re not crossing that lobby.\n\n​Respect the seat: Take a spot, then ghost? You’ll be exiled from the Spice King’s future events. No second chances.\n\n​Special guests: Each night will feature surprise players — the kind who don’t just play the game, they change it.\n\n​Seats are scarce. The vibe is sharp. The room is swank.\n\n​— Spice King of Zanzibar\nhttps://lu.ma/spicekingofzanzibar\n\n———\nRSVP TO OTHER POKER NIGHTS DURING TECHWEEK!\n———\n———\nRSVP TO OTHER POKER NIGHTS DURING TECHWEEK!\n———\nMon Oct 6 - https://partiful.com/e/2s9AgbnP19mlXLQ4zi3C\nTue Oct 7 - https://partiful.com/e/60mj0wQK2dFvfD32WS7A\nWed Oct 8 - https://partiful.com/e/4lctWXCytcey9e4RyVtM\nFri Oct 10 - https://partiful.com/e/GDPbUkJbQoOg06yzEaKR\nSat Oct 11 - https://partiful.com/e/qXfdoYoNqdhuEGvouM64\n\n-----------\nThis event is a part of #SFTechWeek—a week of events hosted by VCs and startups to bring together the tech ecosystem.

She was hit by a car driver (AKA \"Death Monster\") which broke both her legs simultaneously, while she was going to Ocean Beach, to catch the Men's World Surf Competition of American OG Kelly Slater vs rising Brazilian superstar Gabriel Medina. She was released from the hospital on 11/11/11, bionic, with a titanium right leg. Luckily, Fennel fully recovered from the crash, and was able to reproduce a child.\n\nIn 2020, Fennel created D5WR when schools closed during COVID for 2 years. \"In the dark shadow of death*\", Fennel and her (then 7 YO) son began going to the beach park together seeking life, energy, and observation-based learning flow state, as school. D5WR campaigned tirelessly to unlock the path for all, forever, to create health for future generations, and particularly for Black & broke folks living in the city. Health = Wealth.\n\nWe go hard to clear our minds and ideate. We keep going. We hold space for youthful freestyle regenerative energy to compound peace. https://www.strava.com/athletes/67012557\n\n#carfreeisSEXY\n\"Aren't You Tireddddddddd?\" - Kendrick Lamar\n\"Make up is science\" - Kryolan\n\"Let's work\" - Prince\n*Wu-Tang Clan\n\nWe acknowledge the importance of Native American Ohlone stewardship of this land horticulture for 10,000+ years. As well as the need for grassroots action, community empowerment, and the deep connection between environmental health and social well-being, as exemplified by the powerful legacy of the Green Belt Movement's founder, Wangarĩ Maathai, in Kenya. \n\nD5WR is proud to share our core beloved city green pathway with you and yours. We recently transformed some of the deadliest city streets into the most vibrant accessible efficient streets — safe for all living beings (including DT SF office commuters). \n\n#B2Bsempre inspired by: \nM-PESA, Straus Family Creamery, American-Kenyan farmer Kelis, Farming for Hope, Walk SF, SF Bay Area Families For Safe Streets, Rich City Rides, Church of Eight Wheels, Streets For All, Bay Area Outreach and Recreation Program (BORP), Nature in the City, SF New Farm, Westside Collective, and SambaFunk Arts.\n\nPowered by Mischief Marketing: https://www.instagram.com/mischiefrx\n\n​YOU LOOK HOT WHEN YOU SWEAT\n\nThis event is a part of #SFTechWeek—a week of events hosted by VCs and startups to bring together the tech ecosystem.

Current reimbursement already covers device placement and patient biofeedback training, while trials are designed to expand reimbursement to device usage.\n\nEarly data indicate a breakthrough impact — cutting the average radiographic healing time for tibia fractures in half (from 24 to 12 weeks). With proven compliance improvements (4x at NYU Langone) and a potential $55B annual payer savings, our technology is positioned to redefine the standard of care in orthopedic rehabilitation.\n\nWhat makes this event special is the combination of clinical evidence, live patient outcomes, and a clear reimbursement pathway — offering investors a first look at one of the largest value-creation opportunities in orthopedics today\n\nThis event is a part of #SFTechWeek—a week of events hosted by VCs and startups to bring together the tech ecosystem.

Imagine what happens when devices get personalities, toys come alive, and gadgets tell jokes.\n\nIf you’re excited about exploring how AI can spark imagination, creativity, and learning, particularly among children —or if you simply love turning fun ideas into reality through hardware, software, design, or storytelling… this is your place.\n\nWe’re bringing together software & hardware engineers, content creators, product/UI/UX designers, and AI-agent developers who love turning imagination into reality with code, circuits, and creativity.\n\nYour host just returned from a deep dive into Asia’s tech and hardware ecosystems and will share a few informal reflections on what’s brewing in global supply chains - and why design and software are more important than ever for leading players to stay ahead in AI innovation.\n\nThink: caffeine, curious minds, and conversations about bringing imagination to life with code or circuits.\n\nNo panels, no presentations, no pressure - just curious minds, great conversations, and ideas that might one day talk back ✨\n\n👉 If you’re excited about building playful things with AI - whether in code, design, or hardware - come join your people! We're especially curious about toys and tools that help kids learn, play, and grow.\n\nThis event is a part of #SFTechWeek—a week of events hosted by VCs and startups to bring together the tech ecosystem.

    "description": "We stand at civilization's most consequential threshold: the emergence of artificial superintelligence and technologies that may fundamentally alter human cognition itself.\n\nJoin us for a unique 60-minute conversation between two extraordinary minds exploring intelligence, existential risk, and the future of humanity:\n\n🎓 Nick Bostrom — Oxford philosopher, author of the bestselling book Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies, and founding director of the Future of Humanity Institute. His work on existential risk, the simulation hypothesis, and AI governance has shaped how the world's leading institutions think about transformative technology.\n\n🏆 Jonas von Essen — 2X World Memory Champion, co-founder of memoryOS, and holder of multiple world records, including memorizing 100,000 digits of Pi. From game show champion (Jeopardy!, Who Wants to Be a Millionaire) to neurotechnology entrepreneur, Jonas represents the practical frontier of human cognitive enhancement.\n\nWhat We'll Explore: 🔍\n\n⏰ What are the true existential risks of ASI?\n🧬 Risks involved with BMIs having read AND write access to all regions of the brain (injection of false memories and human hacking)\n🎯 What should founders, builders, and investors understand now to be on the right side of history?\n💬 Q&A with the audience\n\nThis is not a debate about gadgets or buzzwords. It is a deep, unsparing exploration of where intelligence itself is heading — and whether we are prepared.\n\nAudience:\n\nThis session is curated for investors, founders, and technologists who are building at the edge of AI, neurotech, and human–machine symbiosis. The conversation promises both inspiration and caution: a rare chance to think about the future with clarity, ambition, and urgency.\n\n--\n\nThis event is a part of #SFTechWeek—a week of events hosted by VCs and startups to bring together the tech ecosystem.

    "description": "From calculator watches to Google Glass, humanity has spent decades trying to merge technology with the body. Some designs became icons. Most ended up in drawers.\n\nMuseum of Wearables Evolution is a one-night immersive installation at the buzzy new World Flagship Store, iconically located on Union Square. We are thrilled to be partnering with World ID, founded by Sam Altman. Our pop-up exhibit will be sharing their space with the World Orb, the innovative and NVIDIA-powered biometric screening device that distinguishes humans from AI.\n\nThis exclusive Taya and Oasis Collective event traces the history of wearable tech: from retro gadgets and failed futures to jewelry that has carried hidden meaning for centuries. Each artifact will be displayed with museum-style plaques, charting what promised to be the future and why it didn’t last.\n\nThe exhibition has sneak peeks of Taya - an AI-powered pendant designed as jewelry first, technology second. It’s our answer to the question: what if wearable tech finally passed the “dead battery test”?\n\nSign up for the waitlist here: tayanecklace.com\n\nThis event is for founders, investors, designers, and the Tech Week community who care about the intersection of hardware, AI, and culture. Join us to explore the lineage of wearables and see some sneak peeks.\n\nThis event is a part of #SFTechWeek—a week of events hosted by VCs and startups to bring together the tech ecosystem.

    "description": "​-----------\n🃏 The Spice King’s Poker Nights at Techweek\n-----------\n​Founders, investors, LPs — the Spice King summons you. During Techweek, every night Sunday through Saturday, I’m hosting a private poker/founders lounge inside the sleek offices of AngelList. Yes, you read that right: poker in the house that built modern startup investing.\n\n​I’ve teamed up with AngelList because there’s no better backdrop for big bets and bold bluffs. Think polished floors, startup lore, and the kind of place where “all-in” could mean your next round.\n\n​*****Drinks & Snacks Included!*****\n\n-----------\nCHOOSE YOUR FLAVOR:\n​At the table (or around it), you’ve got three ways to play:\n-----------\n​- 10c/20c No-Limit Hold ’Em — for the poker-curious\n- ​1/1 No-Limit Hold ’Em — light sparring, the warm-up ring.\n​- 5/5 No-Limit Hold ’Em — where the sharks circle and the pots get real.\n​- Drinks & Socializing — because sometimes the best move is sitting back with a whiskey and letting others show their tells.\n\n-----------\n​Who Belongs Here\n-----------\n​Founders who’ve raised $1M+ (you’ve proven you can ante up).\n​Investors & LPs who know that real deal flow happens after-hours.\n​Anyone who understands that poker is about character, risk, and nerve.\n​Why Show Up?\n\n​Because you’ll learn more about someone’s true game in two hours here than in twenty pitch meetings. Because this is AngelList + the Spice King — two brands that don’t exactly do “casual.” And because in this room, even a losing hand might win you your next deal.\n\n-----------\n​The Ground Rules\n-----------\n​No sneaking in: This is badged-in, ID-checked, guest-list-only. If you’re not approved, you’re not crossing that lobby.\n\n​Respect the seat: Take a spot, then ghost? You’ll be exiled from the Spice King’s future events. No second chances.\n\n​Special guests: Each night will feature surprise players — the kind who don’t just play the game, they change it.\n\n​Seats are scarce. The vibe is sharp. The room is swank.\n\n​— Spice King of Zanzibar\nhttps://lu.ma/spicekingofzanzibar\n\n———\nRSVP TO OTHER POKER NIGHTS DURING TECHWEEK!\n———\n———\nRSVP TO OTHER POKER NIGHTS DURING TECHWEEK!\n———\nMon Oct 6 - https://partiful.com/e/2s9AgbnP19mlXLQ4zi3C\nTue Oct 7 - https://partiful.com/e/60mj0wQK2dFvfD32WS7A\nWed Oct 8 - https://partiful.com/e/4lctWXCytcey9e4RyVtM\nThu Oct 9 - https://partiful.com/e/4ZomYSAK9jE18kGcZez6\nSat Oct 11 - https://partiful.com/e/qXfdoYoNqdhuEGvouM64\n\n-----------\nThis event is a part of #SFTechWeek—a week of events hosted by VCs and startups to bring together the tech ecosystem.

    "description": "​-----------\n🃏 The Spice King’s Poker Nights at Techweek\n-----------\n​Founders, investors, LPs — the Spice King summons you. During Techweek, every night Sunday through Saturday, I’m hosting a private poker/founders lounge inside the sleek offices of AngelList. Yes, you read that right: poker in the house that built modern startup investing.\n\n​I’ve teamed up with AngelList because there’s no better backdrop for big bets and bold bluffs. Think polished floors, startup lore, and the kind of place where “all-in” could mean your next round.\n\n​*****Drinks & Snacks Included!*****\n\n-----------\nCHOOSE YOUR FLAVOR:\n​At the table (or around it), you’ve got three ways to play:\n-----------\n​- 10c/20c No-Limit Hold ’Em — for the poker-curious\n- ​1/1 No-Limit Hold ’Em — light sparring, the warm-up ring.\n​- 5/5 No-Limit Hold ’Em — where the sharks circle and the pots get real.\n​- Drinks & Socializing — because sometimes the best move is sitting back with a whiskey and letting others show their tells.\n\n-----------\n​Who Belongs Here\n-----------\n​Founders who’ve raised $1M+ (you’ve proven you can ante up).\n​Investors & LPs who know that real deal flow happens after-hours.\n​Anyone who understands that poker is about character, risk, and nerve.\n​Why Show Up?\n\n​Because you’ll learn more about someone’s true game in two hours here than in twenty pitch meetings. Because this is AngelList + the Spice King — two brands that don’t exactly do “casual.” And because in this room, even a losing hand might win you your next deal.\n\n-----------\n​The Ground Rules\n-----------\n​No sneaking in: This is badged-in, ID-checked, guest-list-only. If you’re not approved, you’re not crossing that lobby.\n\n​Respect the seat: Take a spot, then ghost? You’ll be exiled from the Spice King’s future events. No second chances.\n\n​Special guests: Each night will feature surprise players — the kind who don’t just play the game, they change it.\n\n​Seats are scarce. The vibe is sharp. The room is swank.\n\n​— Spice King of Zanzibar\nhttps://lu.ma/spicekingofzanzibar\n\n———\nRSVP TO OTHER POKER NIGHTS DURING TECHWEEK!\n———\n———\nRSVP TO OTHER POKER NIGHTS DURING TECHWEEK!\n———\nMon Oct 6 - https://partiful.com/e/2s9AgbnP19mlXLQ4zi3C\nTue Oct 7 - https://partiful.com/e/60mj0wQK2dFvfD32WS7A\nWed Oct 8 - https://partiful.com/e/4lctWXCytcey9e4RyVtM\nThu Oct 9 - https://partiful.com/e/4ZomYSAK9jE18kGcZez6\nFri Oct 10 - https://partiful.com/e/GDPbUkJbQoOg06yzEaKR\n\n-----------\nThis event is a part of #SFTechWeek—a week of events hosted by VCs and startups to bring together the tech ecosystem.
